# Documentation best practices

One sentence per line.
Use asciidoc attributes to reference elements of the application UI.
Use asciidoc attributes to reference URL.
For reference to menus, key on the keyboard... use `backticks`.
Use + on new line in table to force a new line

Decide what you are saying and how: Define the kind of narrator, your tone and your mood
Repeat yourself: a tutorial will have a brief introduction to what you’re going to do, then the actual procedure, and finally a way for you to verify that you’ve done the thing correctly
Avoid using demonstrative pronouns: Instead of saying “this” or “that,” you should add a noun to spell out exactly what you’re referring to.
Simplify: strive to get to the point as quickly as possible
When writing instructions, anywhere you say “You/We should X” or “You/we can X,” replace it with the imperative mood of the verb.
Instead of using constructions with “of” or “for,” rewrite the sentence to put more information before the noun.
Break up long sentences into multiple shorter sentences.
Eliminate passive voice
Don’t use adverbs
Don’t assume knowledge : Spell out acronyms on first use. Add a phrase or a sentence briefly explaining a concept when you introduce it. Link out to further reading.
Be aware of your tone
Avoid jargon and cliches
Make use of whitespace
