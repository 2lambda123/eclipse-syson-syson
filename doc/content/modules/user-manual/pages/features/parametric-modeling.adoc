= Parametric modeling and constraints

In {sysmlv1}, managing block input parameters is an important aspect for modeling complex systems.
{sysmlv1} uses blocks to represent a system's structural elements, and input parameters define the interfaces between them.
Ports are connection points on a block, allowing you to specify the interfaces through that blocks interact with each other.
{sysmlv1} leverages parametric diagrams to define and link input parameters.
This enables precise modeling of interactions and behaviors between system components.
They capture constraints and relationships between parameters within and between blocks.

{sysmlv2} introduces a different approach to managing block input parameters.
{sysmlv2} continues to use ports to define connection points on blocks.
{sysmlv2} swaps parametric diagrams for Interconnection View diagrams in managing block input parameters.

In the {iv} diagram, users can create a new part by clicking on the root node's displayed toolbar.
Then by displaying toolbar on this new node, user can also create port ont the new part.
To represent data flow between ports, user can create either `InterfaceUsage` or `BindingConnector as usage`.
These data flows visually represent how parameter values relate to each other, allowing their propagation through the model.
