= 2025.1.0 (work in progress)

== Key highlights

== Breaking changes

- Improve the code in the import module to make it more generic:
* Delete the `AstConstants` class: Constants have been split across several classes.
* Delete the `LogBook` class (no longer used).
* Replace `AstContainmentReferencePart` with `ContainmentReferenceHandler`.
* Replace `AstObjectParser` with `EAttributeHandler`.
* Replace `AstWeakReferenceParser` with `NonContainmentReferenceHandler`.
* Delete `ReferenceHelper` (no longer used).
* Delete `SysMLUploadDocumentReportProvider` as it is not functional.
* Most components used in the transformation now require a `MessageReporter` instance to collect transformation messages.
- Rework the structure of standard and user libraries in the explorer, the following classes have been renamed to reflect their new usage:
* Rename `StandardLibraryDirectory` to `LibrariesDirectory`.
* Rename `ReferencedLibraryDirectory` to `UserLibrariesDirectory`.

== Dependency update

- [releng] Switch to Sirius Web 2024.11.7

== Bug fixes

- Fix textual export of `LibraryPackage`: the exported file now correctly contains `library package <Package Name>` instead of `package <Package Name>`.
- Fix an issue that made the expand action of the explorer not work on specific filter combinations.
The explorer now correctly allows to expand elements when the _Hide Root Namespaces_ filter is disabled and the `Hide KerML/SysML Standard Libraries` filter is enabled.
- Fix an issue where some error messages were displayed when an element with implicit Specialization was selected and the Related Elements View was displayed.

== Improvements

- `OccurrenceUsage#portionKind` is now `unsettable` and its default value is `null` in the SysMLv2 metamodel to conform to the specification.
- Improve the code in import module, by making it more generic. It now reports (on the server side) more messages to understand the scope of what is imported and the errors encountered.
- Add support of `OccurrenceDefinition` and 'OccurrenceUsage` in export from model to textual SysMLv2.
- Improve the support of libraries in the explorer.
The explorer now contains 2 directories:
*  _Standard Libraries_: contains the SysML and KerML libraries
* _Referenced Libraries_: contains non-standard libraries imported by the user

- Rework the structure of standard and user libraries in the explorer.
The explorer now contains the following directories for libraries:
* _Libraries_: top-level container for all the libraries used in the project
** _KerML_: KerML standard libraries
** _SysML_: SysML standard libraries
** _User Libraries_: User-imported libraries
