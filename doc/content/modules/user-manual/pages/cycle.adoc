= {product} development cycle

{product}, as an open source project, follows a well-defined development cycle to ensure regular and structured updates.
The cycle spans 8 weeks and includes three main phases:

* Development (4 Weeks):
  * Focus: This phase is dedicated to actively working on new features, bug fixes, and enhancements.
  * Activities: Contributors, including community members and core developers, work together to develop new functionalities, perform code reviews, and integrate changes.
  Collaboration and transparency are key during this phase.

* Stabilization and Feature Freeze (2 Weeks):
  * Focus: We enter a feature freeze period where no new features are introduced.
  * Activities: During this time, the focus shifts to thorough testing and stabilization of the new features.
  This ensures the software's quality and reliability.
  Any remaining issues or bugs are addressed to prepare for the release.

* Cool Down and Planning (2 Weeks):

  Additionally, the team discusses and plans the features and tasks for the next cycle, ensuring a smooth transition.
  The General Availability (GA) release of {product} occurs on the eighteenth week of each development cycle.

== Team Organization

Being an open source project, {product} thrives on community participation and collaboration.
