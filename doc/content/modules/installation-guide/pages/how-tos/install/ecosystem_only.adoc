= How to install {product} ecosystem only ?

This section provides a step-by-step guide on setting up the necessary ecosystem to develop the product locally. By following these instructions, youâ€™ll configure your local environment with all required dependencies, tools, and services, enabling you to develop, test, and troubleshoot the product effectively on your own machine.

== Start the database instance

{product} uses PostgreSQL as its database.

For development or local testing, the simplest approach is to initiate a PostgreSQL instance using Docker.

[source, bash]
----
docker run -p 5433:5432 --name syson-postgres \
                            -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \
                            -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd \
                            -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db \
                            -d postgres
----

[TIP]
====
For Windows users, here is the same command on one line:

[source, bash]
----
docker run -p 5433:5432 --name syson-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db -d postgres
----
====

[NOTE]
====
This may take a while the first time you run this as Docker will first pull the PostgreSQL image.
====

If you don't have Docker or prefer to use an existing PostgreSQL installation, modify the following command-line parameters and ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` possesses administrative rights on the database.
These rights are necessary for the automatic creation of the database schema.

[#start-app]
== Start the application

Before you run the application, please ensure you have following the xref:how-tos/requirements.adoc#serverreq[prerequisites] and downloaded the JAR ({product-jar}) from the xref:production_deploy.adoc#download[download] section.

Go to the folder containing the {product-jar} and run the command:"

[source, bash]
----
java -jar path\to\your\syson-application-YEAR.MONTH.0.jar \
          --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/syson-db \
          --spring.datasource.username=dbuser \
          --spring.datasource.password=dbpwd
----

[#openwebbrowser]
== Open your web browser

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to experience {product}.

[TIP]
====
To end your local testing session, ensure you stop the running PostgreSQL Docker container using the command `docker kill syson-postgres`.
Please note that this will erase all the data you have generated during testing.
====

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the xref:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting guide] for detailed solutions.
