= Local installation of {product} for single-user testing purposes

Follow these instructions to install a local version of the application, intended for testing purposes.
This setup is configured for use by the local user only and doesn't include any security configurations.

== Get {product}

[CAUTION]
.Stable versions
====
Only `YEAR.MONTH.0` versions are stable and suitable for production deployments.
Other versions, such as intermediate releases, are intended solely for testing purposes.
They're not recommended for production use due to their potential for further changes and instability.
Always use the stable `.0` releases for any production environments to ensure reliability and support.
For more details see xref:user-manual:cycle.adoc[].

[#docker-install]
== Deploy {product} with Docker Compose

The easiest and most straightforward method to deploy {product} using Docker Compose, which automatically deploy prerequisites.

[NOTE]
====
Before you proceed with the installation, confirm you have the following xref:requirements.adoc[Hardware prerequisites]:

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] installed and running.
====

{product} is distributed as a Docker container.
To deploy {product}, just download the https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/blob/{syson-tag}/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] file and run the following docker command in the same folder as the one where's the _docker-compose.yml_ file:
[source, bash]
----
docker compose up
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
To run Docker Compose confirm your Docker is running.
====

This method deploys {product} matching the version tagged in this documentation with a PostgreSQL database, all within a Docker container.

[TIP]
====
Docker images are build to run on x86_64 architecture.
If you need to run {product} Docker image on a Mac Silicon architecture, run the following command in your terminal before executing the Docker image:

[source, bash]
----
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64
----
====

[NOTE]
====
To deploy a specific version `vYYYY.MM.0`, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and replace the tagged version with your required version.
For example, update the following line in the `docker-compose.yml`:

[source,docker]
----
app:
  image: "${IMAGE_TAG:-eclipsesyson/syson:*vYYYY.MM.0*}"
----
====

All available versions of {product} as Docker containers are listed in the https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipsesyson/syson/tags[{product} Docker registry].

Once your Docker up, go directly to the <<openwebbrowser>>[Open your web browser] section.

[#openwebbrowser]
== Open your web browser

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to experience {product}.

[CAUTION]
====
To end your local testing session, confirm you stop the running PostgreSQL and {product} Docker container and by using the command `docker compose down`.
Note that this erases all the data you have generated during testing.

If you meet any issues during the installation process, see the xref:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting guide] for detailed solutions.
