= How to install {product}?

This section delves into the detailed step-by-step instructions for installing {product}.
Detailed explanations walk you through each step.

== Get {product}

=== Installing {product} with Docker Compose

The easiest and most straightforward method to install {product} using Docker Compose, which automatically installs Java and PostgreSQL.

[INFO]
====
Before you proceed with the installation, please ensure you have the following xref:requirements.adoc[prerequisites]:

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] installed.
====

{product} is distributed as a docker container.
To install {product}, just download the https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/blob/{syson-tag}/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] file and run the following docker command in the same folder as the one where is the _docker-compose.yml_ file:
[source, bash]
----
docker compose up
----

This method installs {product} (matching the version tagged in this documentation) along with a PostgreSQL database, all within a Docker container.

[INFO]
====
To install a specific version vYYYY.MM.0, edit the _docker-compose.yml_ file and replace the tagged version with your desired version. For example, update the following line in the _docker-compose.yml_:
app:
  image: "${IMAGE_TAG:-eclipsesyson/syson:*vYYYY.MM.0*}"
====

All accessible versions of {product} as Docker containers are listed in the https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipsesyson/syson/tags[{product} Docker registry].

Once your Docker up, please go directly to the xref:how-tos/install.adoc#openwebbrowser[Open your web browser] section!

=== Installing {product} Manually

Detailed instructions for manually setting up {product}, including PostgreSQL installation with Docker, downloading the JAR application, and starting it manually.

[INFO]
====
Before you proceed with the installation, please ensure you have the following xref:requirements.adoc[prerequisites]:

* xref:requirements.adoc[Java supported version]
* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] installed, or an existing xref:requirements.adoc[supported database] installation with a user that has administrator privileges.
====

{product} is distributed as a single _executable Java Archive_ `JAR` which contains the complete {product} application along with all its dependencies.
This distribution simplifies the setup process, enabling convenient exploration of {product}'s features.

[CAUTION]
.Stable versions
====
Only `YEAR.MONTH.0` versions are stable and suitable for production deployments.
Other versions, such as intermediate releases, are intended solely for testing purposes.
They're not recommended for production use due to their potential for further changes and instability.
Always use the stable `.0` releases for any production environments to ensure reliability and support.
For more details see xref:user-manual:cycle.adoc[].
====

To download the latest pre-built JAR for {product}, follow these steps:

. Before you begin the installation process, navigate to the {packages-url}[download] page for `{product-jar}` to access all versions.
. Identify the {product} latest available version for download.
+
image::latest-version.png[Latest version]
. Click the latest version to open its specific page.
. In the `Assets` section, locate the JAR file named `{product-jar}`.
+
image::download.png[Download JAR file]
. Click the JAR file to start the download to your local machine.

This process ensures that you get the most recent version of the {product} application in the form of a pre-built JAR file.

==== Start the database instance

{product} uses PostgreSQL as its database.

[TIP]
====
For development or local testing, the simplest approach is to initiate a PostgreSQL instance using Docker.
====

[source, bash]
----
docker run -p 5434:5432 --name syson-postgres \
                            -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \
                            -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd \
                            -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db \
                            -d postgres
----

[TIP]
====
For Windows users, here is the same command on one line:

[source, bash]
----
docker run -p 5434:5432 --name syson-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db -d postgres
----
====

[NOTE]
====
This may take a while the first time you run this as Docker will first pull the PostgreSQL image.
====

If you don't have Docker or prefer to use an existing PostgreSQL installation, modify the following command-line parameters and ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` possesses administrative rights on the database.
These rights are necessary for the automatic creation of the database schema.

[#start-app]
==== Start the application

To run the application, you'll need to use the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to execute the pre-build JAR ({product-jar}) you xref:how-tos/install.adoc#download[downloaded] earlier.

Go to the folder containing the {product-jar} and run the command:"

[source, bash]
----
java -jar path\to\your\syson-application-YEAR.MONTH.0.jar \
          --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5434/syson-db \
          --spring.datasource.username=dbuser \
          --spring.datasource.password=dbpwd
----

[#openwebbrowser]
=== Open your web browser

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to experience {product}.

[TIP]
====
To end your local testing session, ensure you stop the running PostgreSQL Docker container using the command `docker kill syson-postgres`.
Please note that this will erase all the data you have generated during testing.
====

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the xref:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting guide] for detailed solutions.
