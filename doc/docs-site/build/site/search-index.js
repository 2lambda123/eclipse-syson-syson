In some cases, even disabling antivirus software might not be sufficient to resolve performance issues. In such situations, you may need to restart the server or completely uninstall the antivirus software. Here are some specific recommendations for configuring antivirus software for use with SysON server: Exclude SysON Application Folders from Scanning: Identify the installation directory of your SysON application and exclude it from regular antivirus scans. This will minimize the impact of antivirus scanning on SysON performance. Schedule Scanning Times: If possible, schedule antivirus scans during off-peak hours when SysON usage is minimal. This will reduce the likelihood of performance degradation during active usage periods. Configure Real-time Scanning: Adjust real-time scanning settings to minimize the impact on SysON performance. Consider disabling real-time scanning for specific SysON processes or files that are known to cause performance issues. Monitor Resource Utilization: Continuously monitor resource utilization, especially CPU and disk I/O, to identify any potential bottlenecks caused by antivirus software. Adjust scanning settings or consider uninstalling the antivirus software if it significantly impacts SysON performance. Consult with Antivirus Vendor: If you continue to experience performance issues despite optimizing antivirus settings, consider contacting the antivirus vendor for specific guidance on configuring their software for optimal compatibility with SysON applications. Remember, the goal is to achieve a balance between comprehensive antivirus protection and minimizing its impact on SysON performance. By carefully configuring antivirus settings and monitoring resource utilization, you can ensure that your SysON server operates smoothly while maintaining a robust security posture.","title":"Configure Anti-virus software for use with SysON server","component":"syson","version":"v2024.11.0","name":"anti-virus","url":"/syson/v2024.11.0/installation-guide/anti-virus.html","titles":[]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"Before diving into the installation process, it’s crucial to understand the underlying architecture of SysON.

If a platform and version isn’t listed on this page, it implies that this platform and version isn’t tested, bugs fixed, or provided help for. Before diving into the installation process, it’s crucial to understand the underlying architecture of SysON. This section provides a detailed overview of the system’s components, their interactions, and the overall design principles. SysON is a web application, meaning it runs centrally on a server, and users interact with it through web browsers from any computer on the same network. There is one primary method for installing SysON, following the classical client-server model: The server computer runs the SysON Server, N client computers run the SysON Clients. To set up the SysON Server, it’s crucial to meet the specific prerequisites that lay the groundwork for a stable and reliable server environment. Hardware For a small number of projects, less or equal to 10, and about 10-30 users, 100k semantic elements and 1000 representations in total: a recent server featuring a multi-core CPU clocked at 2 GHz and equipped with 4 GB of available RAM, along with a reasonably fast hard drive, 7200 Revolutions Per Minute - RPM or faster, should cater for your needs. Required RAM: 4 GB Recommended RAM 8 GB or more Required CPU: Dual-core processor Recommended CPU: Quad-core processor Disk space: 10 GB for installation Supplementary disk space for application data To enhance performance further, it’s advisable to follow SysON memory usage and assign more memory as needed. In scenarios where your system anticipates a large volume of concurrent requests, deploying SysON applications on a multi-core CPU machine becomes helpful. This strategy increases the concurrency of processing requests, leading to improved response times for your users. Adjusting memory allocation and leveraging multi-core capabilities contribute to optimizing the all system responsiveness. For more information, you can also see Scaling SysON. Operating system SysON operates purely on Java and should function on any supported operating system, given that it meets the JDK / JRE requirements. Linux 64-bit, preferable distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Windows Server 64-bit, recommended versions include Windows Server 2016 or later : Read antivirus in SysON applications. Database To connect your SysON instance to an enterprise database, you must install and configure one of the following supported databases: PostgreSQL 15 Verify that the server has a dedicated PostgreSQL database with administrator rights. Java Runtime Environment - JRE You need to install and configure a separate JRE to run SysON, you have to install a supported version of the Java runtime: Use Java 17 to run the SysON Server. It’s recommended to use the Java runtime provided by the Eclipse Temurin project. Network Connectivity Stable internet connection for updates and communication with SysON Clients. SysON is browser-based software, which means you can run SysON on all full desktop operating systems : MacOS, Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS. Users can interact with the central server through following web browsers: Desktop browsers: Chrome latest stable version Mozilla Firefox latest stable version Mobile browsers: Note that SysON isn’t supported on mobile devices. SysON doesn’t support Internet Explorer. SysON supports a minimal screen resolution of 1024 * 768 with maximized browsers. The minimal operating system - OS requirements are: Windows 10 or later Apple macOS 13.x Ventura and later Any Linux operating system that supports the browsers mentioned earlier Any Chrome operating system that supports the browsers mentioned earlier You can find out what browser and operating system version you have on What’s my Browser. A plugin, add-on, or extension that you have installed in your browser could cause speed, upload, download, or various interface problem with SysON. To see if this is the case you can try disabling all plugins, add-ons, or extensions within your browser. You should aim to offer a network with the lowest possible latency between the client and the server. To get optimal performance, it’s strongly recommend hosting both the server and database on the same physical server to reduce latency between the two components. Virtual Private Network - VPN aren’t recommended. It’s a common latency factor such as other network elements that could drop connections that are more or less inactive. As such wireless connection are also not recommended as any loss of connectivity might lead to instability in the product and loss of data. If a network element of this kind is mandatory, use an SSH tunnel as a workaround to avoid client/server disconnections. SysON should be the unique way to edit the information stored in the database. SysON isn’t warranted to run without any error or interruption. We don’t make any warranty about the statements that are under the section Deployment recommendations, it’s for information purposes.

In SysON, a Project serves as a high-level container that organizes models. You can use projects to group models, providing a structured and efficient way to manage your content. It’s important to note that creating sub-projects within a project isn’t supported. All models exist at the same level within a project. This design ensures simplicity and clarity in organizing and accessing your models, fostering a straightforward and intuitive project management experience. In SysON, projects are public. Public projects are visible by everyone. In SysON, a model represents a comprehensive and structured representation of a system, capturing its various aspects, components, and relationships. These models serve as fundamental building blocks for organizing and articulating the design, behavior, and structure of a system. Notably, all models within SysON adhere to the SysML v2 language metamodel, ensuring compliance with standardized specifications. This adherence to the SysML v2 metamodel enhances interoperability, consistency, and compatibility across the modeling landscape, making models integral components for effective system engineering and collaborative project development. Discover the SysML v2 language…​ In the context of SysON, a representation serves as a visual depiction or interpretation of a system, capturing specific aspects and viewpoints. Essentially, it’s one of the possible views within the SysML v2 framework. Representations offer a means to illustrate and communicate diverse facets of a system, aiding in the comprehensive understanding of its structure, behavior, and relationships. These visual depictions play a pivotal role in model-based systems engineering, offering a nuanced and graphical approach to convey complex information in a more visible manner.

The cycle spans 8 weeks and includes three main phases: Development (4 Weeks): Focus: This phase is dedicated to actively working on new features, bug fixes, and enhancements. Activities: Contributors, including community members and core developers, work together to develop new functionalities, perform code reviews, and integrate changes. Collaboration and transparency are key during this phase. Stabilization and Feature Freeze (2 Weeks): Focus: We enter a feature freeze period where no new features are introduced. Activities: During this time, the focus shifts to thorough testing and stabilization of the new features. This ensures the software’s quality and reliability. Any remaining issues or bugs are addressed to prepare for the release. Cool Down and Planning (2 Weeks): Focus: This phase involves wrapping up the current cycle and preparing for the next one. Activities: Contributors work on upgrading dependencies, resolving minor issues, and documenting the latest changes. Additionally, the team discusses and plans the features and tasks for the next cycle, ensuring a smooth transition. The General Availability (GA) release of SysON occurs on the eighteenth week of each development cycle. Being an open source project, SysON thrives on community participation and collaboration. Here’s how the team is organized: * Core Developers: these are the primary maintainers who oversee the project’s direction, manage releases, and ensure code quality. * Contributors: this includes anyone from the community who contributes code, documentation, or ideas. Contributions are reviewed and merged by core developers. * Community: a diverse group of users, testers, and enthusiasts who provide feedback, report bugs, and propose new features. This collaborative approach allows SysON to continuously evolve while maintaining a high standard of quality and performance. If you’re interested in contributing or have any questions, feel free to join the community discussions or contact us. SysON adheres to a CalVer (Calendar Versioning) strategy to communicate the timeline and stability of its releases. The versioning follows a YEAR.MONTH.PATCH format, where: YEAR.MONTH.0: These are the stable releases, marking significant milestones or major updates. For example, a version like 2024.5.0 indicates a stable release from May 2024. Intermediate Releases: Between the .0 versions, there may be multiple intermediate releases, denoted by increasing the PATCH number (for example 2024.5.1, 2024.5.2). These are intended to provide updates, fixes, and incremental improvements leading up to the next stable release. Stable versions (.0 versions) are recommended for production environments, while intermediate versions offer early access to new features and fixes but might undergo further changes before the next stable release. This strategy ensures that users can rely on a predictable and transparent update cycle, aligning with the continuous evolution and enhancement of SysON. For all details about the different versions, see the https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/blob/main/CHANGELOG.adoc:`CHANGELOG`.","title":"SysON development cycle","component":"syson","version":"v2024.11.0","name":"cycle","url":"/syson/v2024.11.0/user-manual/cycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Try it out and give feedback by reporting bugs and suggesting new features. It’s not recommended for production use. 👥 This feature is available to all users. The General view is employed to display any members of exposed model elements. it’s the most general view, enabling presentation of any model element. This view in SysON is implemented as an unsynchronized diagram. This means that users need to manually add existing elements to the diagram to visualize them. It doesn’t display all the information stored in the model by default. User can create General view diagram on any element provided it inherits from Namespace type. The Diagram panel has global actions grouped in a horizontal toolbar underneath the diagram tabs. This toolbar has the following actions: Display full screen, Fit selection to screen, Zoom group: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Share the diagram link, Export diagram as SVG, Toggle snap to grid, Show helper line to align elements, Arrange all elements, Reveal hidden elements, Reveal faded elements, Unpin all elements. Six categories of elements can be represented on General view diagram. The following Definition elements can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Definition, Allocation Definition, Attribute Definition, Constraint Definition, Enumeration Definition, Interface Definition, Item Definition, Metadata Definition, Occurrence Definition, Part Definition, Port Definition, Requirement Definition, UseCase Definition. Definition elements are represented by rectangular node style. Keyword with \"Def\" specification is defined in the label of the node. The following Usage elements can be displayed in the General view diagram: Accept Action usage, Action Usage, Allocation Usage, Attribute Usage, Constraint Usage, Interface Usage, Item Usage, Occurrence Usage, Part Usage, Port Usage, Requirement Usage, UseCase Usage. Usage elements are represented by rectangular node style with rounded corner. The following element in Definition compartments can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Definition can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action, Attribute in Attribute Definition/Interface Definition/Item Definition/Metadata Definition/Occurrence Definition/Part Definition/Port Definition/Requirement Definition, Constraint in Constraint Definition, Documentation in all Definition elements, Enumerated Value in Enumeration Definition, Interface in Interface Definition, Port in Interface Definition/Part Definition, Reference in Metadata Definition/Port Definition, Occurence in Occurrence Definition, Assumed Constraint in Requirement Definition, Required Constraint in Requirement Definition. Each element in Definition nodes are represented in dedicated compartment. A Definition node can have several compartments if Definition element can contain many kind of element. Each compartment is distinguished by a specific identifier. The following element in Usage compartments can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Usage can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action, Item in Action Usage, Allocation in Allocation Usage, Attribute in Attribute Usage/Interface Usage/Item Usage/Part Usage/Port Usage/Requirement Usage, Reference in Attribute Usage/Item Usage/Port Usage, Constraint in Constraint Usage, Documentation in all Usage elements, Port in Interface Usage/Part Usage, Occurrence in Occurrence Usage, Assumed Constraint in Requirement Usage, Required constraint in Requirement Usage. Each element in Definition nodes are represented in dedicated compartment. A Definition node can have several compartments if Definition element can contain many kind of element. Each compartment is distinguished by a specific identifier. Package element can be represented on General view diagram. It is represented by a folder and its label has the keyword package. Annotating elements such as Documentation and Comment elements can be represented on General view diagram. It is represented by a note node and its label contains the body of the Annotating element in addition to its declared name. The label of Documentation node also includes the keyword doc whereas the label of Comment node includes the keyword comment. The following Relationship can be displayed in the General view diagram: Dependency, Subclassification, Redefinition, Subsetting, Feature Typing, Allocation, Containment relation, Succession. User can create element from the background of the diagram from a simple click that displays toolbar. In this toolbar, element creation tool are grouped by type in tool section according to their type. User can expand the tool section and then user can click on the desired creation tool User can also create element in other element. User just clicks on the element to display the toolbar and then click on the desired creation tool. All created element are collapsed by default, it means that if a node with compartment is created, compartment are hidden. If node contains compartment, user can add element in the desired compartment by clicking in the compartment and display the toolbar. An other way is to click on the parent node header of the compartment. A toolbar will be display and the user can click on the desired creation tool, new element will be created in the appropriate compartment. User can only delete a graphical element from the diagram without removing it from the model. User should just click on Delete from diagram button in the palette. User can also remove element from model (and so from diagram) by clicking on Delete from model button in the palette. A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the Delete from model tool in the palette or via the Model Explorer. This behavior can be disabled by checking the \"Disable this confirmation dialog\" checkbox in the dialog. This preference is stored in the local storage of the browser. You can reset it by deleting the SysON data in cache of your browser. Relationship Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge’s source and target types. If no edge creation is authorized with a given target, the target node appears faded. When user try to create an edge, user clicks first on the source element to display arrow border. Then user clicks on one of these arrows and stay click until the target. User can see the feedback of the edge and the target node is highlighted. After releasing the click, a pop-up appears and displays all possible kind of edge to create. If only one kind of edge is possible, the edge is directly create without opening the pop-up. it’s not possible for now to create an Edge between two Edges or between an Edge and a Node. Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element. If the new source or the new target isn’t allowed for reconnection, these one will be faded. To delete relationship from model, user should click on the edge and click on the delete button. Remember that relationship edge are always synchronized, it’s not possible to only delete relationship edge from diagram. Containment relationShip isn’t deletable from the diagram. Other relationship can be deletable from the diagram. Keywords on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label. For example Definition nodes will be prefixed with \"part def\" and Usage node with \"part\". After the keyword, the label can be the simple name of the element, or more complex in some specific cases. Indeed, For example, subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax is supported to describe some element. For simple Definition element, the label will display the keyword \"part def\" and its declared name. For elements using specialization, the label will display the kind of the specilalization. For example, if a Batmobile is a subclassification of Vehicle, its label will display the key word \"part def\" and then \"Batmobile :> Vehicle\" to show its specalization toward Vehicle. If Usage element is given by relationship with multiplicity, the multiplicity value (upper and lower bound) is specified between bracket in the label, just before the specialization. For example, for a Batmobile which contained 4 Wheel by using the Usage wheels then the label will be composed of the keyword \"part\" followed by the name wheels[4] : Wheel which described the Usage wheels with multiplicity 4 defined by the Definition Wheel. For element with compartment node (with list layout), the label of compartment node will be displayed in italic and it will only contained a simple name. No label is defined on edges except in two cases : allocation edge label is specified with its keyword allocate, edge which represent relationship with multiplicity have their multiplicity defined in their label (ex.: containment edge). Element labels can be edited in the following ways: Edit action of the Palette, Press F2, Type directly the new name. With direct edit, user can’t change the keyword but user can change the name. If it’s a simple label, he can rename the element. If user modify the multiplicity defined in the label then the multiplicity of the relationship is changed in the model. User can alos set/change the specialization of a given element. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for direct edit action Label of edges and compartments node can’t be edited. Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram. This drag and drop doesn’t perform any semantic modification. Diagrams also allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram. Note that it’s not possible to Drag and drop an element represented as an Edge on the diagram. User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node. Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded. When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted. From the diagram background or from a given node, it’s possible to display all existing elements contained by the initial selection. User just need to display the palette and unfold Existing elements section. User can click on Add existing elements to display elements directly contained by the selection. User can also click on Add existing elements (recursive) to display elements directly contained by the selection and elements contained by these elements and so on. When user select multiple elements, many actions are available to manage all selected element. After user selected some elements, a simplified toolbar is displayed. User can still used basic tools such as : Hide elements, Fade elements, Pin elements. A new tool section appears in this toolbar. Many tools acting on selected elements layout can be found in this tool section : Align left, Align center, Align right, Align top, Align middle, Align bottom, Arrange in row, Arrange in column, Arrange in grid, Distribute horizontal spacing, Distribute vertical spacing, Justify horizontally, Justify vertically, Make same size. In addition to toolbar actions, some actions can be execute with shortcuts. Indeed, after user selected some elements, user can press the key \"Del\" to remove all selected elements. User can also move all selected element on the diagram without changing its graphical or semantic parent.","title":"General view","component":"syson","version":"v2024.11.0","name":"general-view","url":"/syson/v2024.11.0/user-manual/features/general-view.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The Projects Browser page serves as the pivotal starting point for your modeling endeavors and is the homepage of the SysON application. It offers a central hub where users can seamlessly create new projects or manage existing ones. For newcomers to SysON, the initial experience of opening the application might seem a bit overwhelming. To assist you in navigating and initiating collaboration with your team, we offer a guided tour to help you acclimate to the platform. The homepage features three distinct regions: a Toolbar, a Create a New Project section, and an Existing Projects section. We’ve streamlined the layout to offer a clear understanding of the content housed in each location. The toolbar consists of two groups, each featuring a single action: Homepage and Help. The Homepage action, visible on all pages of the application, provides a convenient way to navigate back to the Projects Browser, serving as the application’s main homepage. The Help action, accessible on every page of the application, offers a convenient pathway to navigate to the online help resources for SysON. The Create New Project section is designed to allow users to initiate the creation of a new project. Within the platform, initiating a new project is a user-friendly process that accommodates various preferences: Create a Blank Project: Users can start their modeling journey with an empty project, building a project from the ground up. With blank project, there is no model and no representation at creation. Create a Project from Existing Templates: For efficiency and consistency, users can select from predefined templates that streamline project initiation, aligning with common modeling scenarios. The 3 first possible templates are displayed unitary at the beginning of Project sections and they’re also available in \"Show all templates\" section. For now, there exist two available templates : Batmobile and SysMLv2. Batmobile- template is a complete SysML project with several concepts of each SysML type (kind of _Definitions and Usages with relationships). SysMLv2 is an empty SysML project with only the root model, a Package and a General view representation. Upload a Previously Exported Project: Facilitating collaboration and workflow continuity, users can effortlessly upload a project previously exported, ensuring seamless transitions and flexibility in collaboration. Every project you create have its own Project Editor. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for creating blank projects, generating projects from templates, or uploading existing ones. The Existing Projects section streamlines project navigation, allowing users to effortlessly browse through their available projects. It facilitates the opening of pre-existing projects and provides essential actions for project management, including options to rename, download, and delete projects using the \"3 dots\" icon on the right side of each project.","title":"Projects Browser","component":"syson","version":"v2024.11.0","name":"homepage","url":"/syson/v2024.11.0/user-manual/features/homepage.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Traceability features","hash":"_traceability_features","id":2}]},"55":{"id":55,"text":"SysON is designed to handle a wide range of modeling tasks and accommodate various scales of usage. However, understanding the scaling limits of the system is essential for planning and optimizing your usage to ensure performance and efficiency. Below, we outline the primary scaling factors and limitations related to model size, semantic elements, representations, project management, and user concurrency. Maximum Model Size: SysON is built to manage large models, but there are practical limits to its capacity. The system can efficiently handle models up to about 10 MB in size. Models larger than this might experience performance degradation, especially in terms of loading times and responsiveness. Impact on Performance: As model size increases, users might meet longer loading times and slower response rates when performing operations such as editing or navigating the model. It’s recommended to break down exceptionally large models into smaller, manageable sub-models where feasible. Element Capacity: SysON can manage models containing up to 150,000 semantic elements. These elements include elements, relationships, and attributes that define the structure and behavior of the model. Performance Considerations: Exceeding this number might lead to increased memory usage and slower query responses. For optimal performance, it’s advisable to maintain a balance and avoid overly complex models that push the upper limit of this capacity. Representation Limits: The system supports up to 2,000 distinct representations per project. Complexity and Usability: While the system can handle a high number of representations, maintaining a clear and organized structure is crucial. Overloading a project with too many representations can complicate navigation and reduce usability. Element Density: A single representation can display up to 1,000 elements. Beyond this, the representation might become cluttered, making it difficult to interpret and work with the visual data. Performance and Visualization: High-density representations may slow down rendering times and interaction speed. It’s beneficial to segment large visualizations into smaller, more focused views to maintain clarity and performance. Project Management: SysON can support up to 1,000 concurrent projects per server. This allows organizations to manage multiple initiatives simultaneously without significant performance degradation. Server Load: The number of projects impacts server load and resource allocation. While the system can support a high number of projects, each project adds to the computational and storage demands, so server capacity should be scaled so. User Capacity: The system is designed to support up to 80 concurrent users on a single server. This capacity ensures that people can collaborate in real-time without encountering significant slowdowns or access issues. Collaboration Dynamics: The performance of collaborative features, such as live editing and real-time updates, might vary depending on the number of users and the complexity of the operations being performed. For larger teams, it’s important to monitor server load and possibly segment users across multiple servers if necessary. Model Partitioning: To manage large models, consider breaking them down into smaller, modular sub-models. This can help maintain performance and make it easier to manage and navigate complex data. Efficient Representations: Limit the number of elements displayed in each representation to avoid clutter and maintain responsiveness. Use multiple, focused representations instead of one overloaded view. Scalable Infrastructure: Ensure that your server infrastructure is scalable to handle increases in project load and user concurrency. This might involve using cloud-based solutions that can dynamically allocate resources as needed. Regular Monitoring: Implement regular monitoring of system performance and user activity to identify and address potential bottlenecks. This can help maintain smooth operation even as the scale of use increases. Contact us for custom solutions: If your needs exceed the outlined limits or you require specific performance optimizations, please contact us. Our team can provide tailored solutions and advice to ensure that SysON meets your scaling requirements effectively. If you need to go upper than the detailed limits contact-us.","title":"Scaling limits","component":"syson","version":"v2024.11.0","name":"scaling-limits","url":"/syson/v2024.11.0/user-manual/features/scaling-limits.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In the context of Model-Based Systems Engineering - MBSE, where diverse teams contribute to different facets of a project, having an open source tool becomes a unifying force. It allows seamless collaboration and information exchange among stakeholders, regardless of their preferred tools or methodologies. SysON empowers users to seamlessly transition between graphical and textual representations, accommodating diverse modeling preferences and the specific demands of the systems under analysis. This flexibility is crucial in MBSE, where the ability to articulate and refine models in different modalities is instrumental in capturing the complexity inherent in modern system designs. The extensibility of SysML v2 within SysON is a key aspect that reinforces its adaptability to diverse industries and complex project landscapes. In MBSE, where each domain might have unique requirements and specifications, having a tool that can be tailored to meet these specific needs is invaluable. SysON’s extensibility ensures that it remains a dynamic and adaptable resource for system engineers working across various domains. As SysON evolves, guided by the principles of SysML v2, it positions itself as more than just a tool; it evolves into a comprehensive and standardized environment for MBSE endeavors. The commitment to open source and interoperability serves as a cornerstone for future developments, ensuring that SysON continues to meet the evolving needs of the MBSE community. In essence, SysON stands as an open source enabler, promoting collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability—fundamental principles in the ever-evolving landscape of MBSE. SysON extends its utility by introducing the capability to import and export projects in JSON format. This feature enhances interoperability, allowing users to seamlessly exchange project data and collaborate with external tools or platforms. SysON doesn’t support the SysML v2 Standard JSON format for import/export. For detailed instructions on downloading projects, downloading models, uploading projects, and uploading models, please refer to the respective sections in the documentation. These sections provide step-by-step guidance on how to perform these actions within the SysON environment. SysON support SysML v2 textual specifications as an exchange format in order facilitate smooth transitions between tools. This intent reflects SysON’s dedication to staying aligned with evolving industry standards. Add-on has been developed to enable import/export capability to and from SysML v2 textual syntax. This feature provides users with additional flexibility in their modeling workflows. Before importing a file, you need to make sure that all the dependences of this file are also imported, and this, recursively. Otherwise some relationship won’t be resolved. For example if you want to import a file that uses third party libraries, you will need to import the third party libraries before the actual file, otherwise you might have unreferenced relations. Most important SysML v2 concepts can be translated from the imported file, some concept are still under development to enable complete import/export capability from and to SysML v2 textual syntax. Stay tuned for updates on its availability in the project. The following example shows an example of SysML v2 content file to import: package PictureTaking { part def Exposure; action def Focus { out xrsl: Exposure; } action def Shoot { in xsf: Exposure; } action takePicture { action focus: Focus[1]; flow focus.xrsl to shoot.xsf; action shoot: Shoot[1]; } }","title":"Interoperability","component":"syson","version":"v2024.11.0","name":"interoperability","url":"/syson/v2024.11.0/user-manual/integration/interoperability.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The changes are: AnnotatingElement add derived reference \"ownedAnnotatingRelationship : Annotation\" Annotation add derived reference \"owningAnnotatingElement : AnnotatingElement\" Connector remove attribute \"isDirected : boolean\" OperatorExpression remove derived reference \"operand : Expression\" ParameterMembership add operation \"parameterDirection() : FeatureDirectionKind\" Type add operation \"directionOfExcluding(Feature, Type[0..\\*]) : FeatureDirectionKind\" Refactor and simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram, the following classes have been deleted, renamed, or merged: Deleted InterconnectionViewForDefinitionDescriptionProvider Deleted InterconnectionViewForDefinitionDiagramDescriptionProvider Deleted InterconnectionViewForUsageDiagramDescriptionProvider Merged RootUsageNodeDescriptionProvider and RootDefinitionNodeDescriptionProvider into RootNodeDescriptionProvider Renamed FirstLevelChildPartUsageNodeDescriptionProvider to FirstLevelChildUsageNodeDescriptionProvider Renamed ChildPartUsageNodeDescriptionProvider to ChildUsageNodeDescriptionProvider Switch to Sirius Web 2024.7.1: all diagrams must be deleted and created again, due to the fix of this Sirius Web bug. Add tool to create an ExhibitState from a StateUsage, the following classes & methods have been deleted or modified to simplify the handling of ExhibitStates Deleted StateTransitionToggleExhibitStateToolProvider Deleted UtilService#canBeExhibitedStateUsage Deleted UtilService#setUnsetAsExhibit Deleted UtilService#isExhibitedStateUsage Deleted UtilService#getAllReachableStatesWithoutReferencialExhibitExpression Deleted ViewNodeService#isHiddenByDefaultExhibitStates Deleted ViewNodeService#isHiddenByDefaultNonExhibitStates Add new IViewDiagramElementFinder parameter to StateTransitionViewNodeToolSectionSwitch Migrate frontend to MUI 5, if you contributed React components that use MUI, you should upgrade them to use MUI 5. Ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed, the following methods have been moved to support this feature The method ToolService#dropElementFromExplorer has been moved to ViewToolService since it now requires view-related imports that motivated this refactoring. The method ToolService#dropElementFromDiagram has been moved to ViewToolService for the sake of consistency. Fix Add Existing Elements tool for start and done actions, the following methods have been moved to UtilService to make them reusable by different services (they are now used by ViewNodeService and ViewToolService): ViewNodeService#getAllStandardStartActions ViewNodeService#getAllStandardDoneActions ViewNodeService#isAction ViewNodeService#isPart Split DiagramDirectEditListener#exitExpression directEdit service into two services : exitNodeExpression and exitListItemExpression to specify the grahical context of use . Add new boolean parameter isCompartmentItem to the LabelService#directEdit service to clarify the graphical element type to edit. Rename LabelService#getUsagePrefix into getUsageListItemPrefix to specify the computation of this prefix on list item elements. Rename ViewLabelService#getInitialDirectEditLabel service into getInitialDirectEditListItemLabel to specify the computation of the initial label on list item elements. Fix an issue that revealed the documentation compartment when dropping an element on itself, the following method’s contract has been updated as part of the fix: EMFUtils#isAncestor(parent, eObject) now returns true if parent == eObject. Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package, the tool Create Package is not available in Action Flow View diagrams anymore. Switch to Sirius Web 2024.9.0 Migrate frontend to MUI 5 Switch to maven-checkstyle-plugin 3.4.0 Switch to Spring Boot 3.3.1 Add a dependency to CycloneDX to compute the backend software bill of materials during the build Add a dependency to pathfinding Prevent nested part to be rendered as border nodes in the Interconnection View diagram. Fix an issue where a click on inherited members inside compartments was raising an error instead of displaying the palette. Fix an issue where non-containment references in standard libraries weren’t correctly imported into the project’s editing context. Remove owning Usage memberships from inherited memberships of Usages. Memberships of a Type are inherited via Specialization or Conjugation, not by composition. Fix an issue that allowed to drop an element from the explorer or the diagram on one of its children. Doing so deleted both the dropped element and its children from the diagram, and could delete the representation if one of the element was the root element of the representation. Fix an issue that made the direct edit not working on Constraint and Requirement elements. Fix an issue that made the addExistingElements not work properly for start and done actions inside actions and parts. Fix an issue on constraint expression name resolution that prevented from referencing elements in other containing namespaces than the direct owner of the constraint. It is now possible to reference an element in any of the containing namespaces of the constraint. Fix an issue that deleted the content of an action when it was dropped from the diagram to an action flow compartment. Fix an issue where it was impossible anymore to set the cardinality of an Element as graphical node through direct edit. Fix an issue where ConjugatedPortDefinition labels were rendered as null instead of their actual name. Fix an issue that made direct edit of names not working on nodes in the Interconnection View diagram. Fix an issue that revealed the documentation compartment when dropping an element on itself. The drop isn’t allowed anymore, and a warning message is displayed. Fix an issue that deleted feature typing specialization when nesting a PartUsage in a PartDefinition. The tool Add Part as nested Part now correctly keeps the existing relationships of the PartUsage after its owner is changed. Fix an issue that prevented the drop of the root element of a diagram on its background. Fix an issue that made all the elements references when imported by the SysMLParser. Add actions in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add states in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add ExhibitStates on General View diagram Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a PartUsage/PartDefinition Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a StateUsage/StateDefinition The InterfaceUsage created by the New Interface edge tool in the Interconnection View diagram are now created under closest containing Definition/Package. Simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram and remove duplicated code Add action node in Interconnection View diagram Add documentation and action flow compartments for action nodes in the Interconnection View diagram Add label support for referential Usages Nodes that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword Elements in lists that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword AttributeUsage do not contain the \"ref\" keyword since they are always referential Add support for \"ref\" keyword in direct edit Prefixing the name of an Usage with \"ref\" sets it as a reference Not setting the \"ref\" prefix of an Usage sets it as a composite (non-reference) Use empty diamond source style for nested reference usage edge Nested usages that are composite are connected by a filled diamond edge Nested usages that are references are connected by an empty diamond edge Modify the creation of an ExhibitState from a StateUsage or StateDefinition. There is now several tools for creating an ExhibitState. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. Display qualified names in diagrams nodes' labels in case of standard libraries elements. Allow to select existing Action on Perform tool. Allow to set measurement units via direct edit. It is now possible to configure the measurement unit for the value of an element, e.g. mass = 10 [kg]. Allow to select existing Type on Subject tool. Display prefix keywords in label for Usage compartment element Display multiplicity suffix property keywords in label for Usage element Allow direct edit of prefix keywords and multiplicity suffix for Usage elements Prefixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with direction or \"abstract\" or \"variation\" or \"readonly\" or \"derived\" or \"end\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Suffixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with \"ordered\" or \"nonunique\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Add support for constraint expressions in the general view. Constraints with expressions such as mass >= 10 [kg] are now correctly parsed and the corresponding semantic objects are created in the constraint. Add actors compartment in UseCase and Requirement in the General View diagram. Handle the representation of actors on the General View diagram. Actors are represented with a stick figure image, with their label displayed below the image. Add support for edges between actors and their containing UseCase/Requirement in the General View diagram. The source of the edge (the UseCase or Requirement) can be reconnected to another UseCase or Requirement, but the target (Actor) cannot be reconnected. Allow to select existing RequirementUsage and RequirementDefinition on Objective tool. Add a check to make the build fail if a Cypress test contains it.only. Add support for public import in direct edit specializations. It is now possible to specialize an element with a qualified name containing namespaces importing the required features. For example, myAttribute : ISQ::MassValue now correctly types the attribute with ISQBase::MassValue. Improve the support of root Namespaces in SysON documents. Root Namespaces are now implicitly created at the root of SysON documents. Creating an element at the root of a SysON document now creates it in its root Namespace. A new filter is available to hide root Namespaces and is enabled by default. It is no longer possible to create Namespace from the explorer. It is no longer possible to create a representation on a root Namespace. Improve the drop from the explorer to ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed. Display prefix keywords in labels of Definitions and Usages graphical nodes. Ensure that dropping an element from the explorer on the diagram reveals the corresponding node if it is already on the diagram and hidden. A warning message is now displayed when attempting to drop an element which is already displayed and visible in the target container. Ignore keywords order during direct edit of prefixes labels of Definitions and Usages graphical elements. DirectEdit on graphical node or list item authorized only to modify keywords which can be displayed in each label. Allow to drop a Definition from the explorer on an Usage on a diagram or in a list compartment to type it. Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package. Add \"Show/Hide Icons in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide icons in the diagrams (icons are not part of the SysMLv2 specification). Add new tools allowing to create an ExhibitState at the root of General View and StateTransition View. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. The selected State will be added to the diagram, not the new ExhibitState. Handle FlowConnectionUsage between PortUsages in Interconnection View. A new edge tool allows to create a flow between two ports. Add tools to set a Feature as composite or reference. Handle ItemUsage in Interconnection View and FlowConnectionUsage using items as their source/target. Add documentation property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a documentation for the selected element. This property widget will only handle the first documentation associated to the selected element. If no documentation is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a Documentation element and will associate it to the selected element. Add new \"New objects from text\" menu entry on elements in Explorer view, allowing to insert textual SysMLv2 as objects under the selected element. The menu entry shows a dialog with a textarea allowing to write or paste textual SysMLv2. A click on the Insert button converts the textual SysMLv2 into model elements and add them under the selected element. Improve the drag and drop of container elements to move their content. Handle implicit specializations from standard libraries for Usages/Definitions. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from users models in diagrams. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members from Standard Libraries in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from standard libraries in diagrams.","title":"2024.9.0","component":"syson","version":"v2024.11.0","name":"2024.9.0","url":"/syson/v2024.11.0/user-manual/release-notes/2024.9.0.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The custom node is resizable and the text content is wrapped (back to the line) if it is too long compare to the node size. Represent Documentation as Note graphical node. The Documentation graphical node can appear when user drag and drop Documentation element from explorer on the diagram. The Documentation graphical node is linked to its documented element by an edge and the node can only appear if the documented element is represented on the diagram. Display prefix keywords in labels of Documentation graphical nodes. Allow creation of Comment from the Explorer view. Add Comment representation in graphical views. The Comment graphical node can appear when user drag and drop Comment element from explorer on the diagram but also when user handle creation tool from the palette. The Comment graphical node is linked to its annotated element by an edge and the node can only appear if the annotated element is represented on the diagram. Display prefix keywords in labels of Comment graphical nodes. Add Comment property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a Comment for the selected element. This property widget will only handle the first Comment associated to the selected element. If no Comment is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a Comment element and will associate it to the selected element. Add an edge tool to add target element as nested usage. This complements the existing tool that allows to add the source element as a nested usage of the target. Introduce SysMLv2 REST APIs. In this first implementation we will only implement the following REST APIs, thanks to Sirius Web: Project-related REST APIs: getProjects (GET /api/rest/projects): Get all projects. getProjectById (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}): Get project with the given id (projectId). createProject (POST /projects): Create a new project with the given name and description (optional). deleteProject (DELETE /api/rest/projects/{projectId}): Delete the project with the given id (projectId). updateProject (PUT /projects/{projectId}): Update the project with the given id (projectId). Object-related REST APIs. getElements (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements): Get all the elements in a given project at the given commit. There are no commits in Sirius Web so you can use the same Id as the projectId for the commitId. getElementById (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements/{elementId}): Get element with the given id (elementId) in the given project at the given commit. There are no commits in Sirius Web so you can use the same Id as the projectId for the commitId. getRelationshipsByRelatedElement (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements/{elementId}/relationships): Get relationships that are incoming, outgoing, or both relative to the given related element.

Fix an issue where non-containment references in standard libraries weren’t correctly imported into the project’s editing context. Remove owning Usage memberships from inherited memberships of Usages. Memberships of a Type are inherited via Specialization or Conjugation, not by composition. Fix an issue that allowed to drop an element from the explorer or the diagram on one of its children. Doing so deleted both the dropped element and its children from the diagram, and could delete the representation if one of the element was the root element of the representation. Fix an issue that made the direct edit not working on Constraint and Requirement elements. Fix an issue that made the addExistingElements not work properly for start and done actions inside actions and parts. Fix an issue on constraint expression name resolution that prevented from referencing elements in other containing namespaces than the direct owner of the constraint. It is now possible to reference an element in any of the containing namespaces of the constraint. Fix an issue that deleted the content of an action when it was dropped from the diagram to an action flow compartment. Fix an issue where it was impossible anymore to set the cardinality of an Element as graphical node through direct edit. Fix an issue where ConjugatedPortDefinition labels were rendered as null instead of their actual name. Fix an issue that made direct edit of names not working on nodes in the Interconnection View diagram. Fix an issue that revealed the documentation compartment when dropping an element on itself. The drop isn’t allowed anymore, and a warning message is displayed. Fix an issue that deleted feature typing specialization when nesting a PartUsage in a PartDefinition. The tool Add Part as nested Part now correctly keeps the existing relationships of the PartUsage after its owner is changed. Fix an issue that prevented the drop of the root element of a diagram on its background. Fix an issue that made all the elements references when imported by the SysMLParser. Add actions in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add states in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add ExhibitStates on General View diagram Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a PartUsage/PartDefinition Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a StateUsage/StateDefinition The InterfaceUsage created by the New Interface edge tool in the Interconnection View diagram are now created under closest containing Definition/Package. Simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram and remove duplicated code Add action node in Interconnection View diagram Add documentation and action flow compartments for action nodes in the Interconnection View diagram Add label support for referential Usages Nodes that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword Elements in lists that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword AttributeUsage do not contain the \"ref\" keyword since they are always referential Add support for \"ref\" keyword in direct edit Prefixing the name of an Usage with \"ref\" sets it as a reference Not setting the \"ref\" prefix of an Usage sets it as a composite (non-reference) Use empty diamond source style for nested reference usage edge Nested usages that are composite are connected by a filled diamond edge Nested usages that are references are connected by an empty diamond edge Modify the creation of an ExhibitState from a StateUsage or StateDefinition. There is now several tools for creating an ExhibitState. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. Display qualified names in diagrams nodes' labels in case of standard libraries elements. Allow to select existing Action on Perform tool. Allow to set measurement units via direct edit. It is now possible to configure the measurement unit for the value of an element, e.g. mass = 10 [kg]. Allow to select existing Type on Subject tool. Display prefix keywords in label for Usage compartment element Display multiplicity suffix property keywords in label for Usage element Allow direct edit of prefix keywords and multiplicity suffix for Usage elements Prefixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with direction or \"abstract\" or \"variation\" or \"readonly\" or \"derived\" or \"end\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Suffixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with \"ordered\" or \"nonunique\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Add support for constraint expressions in the general view. Constraints with expressions such as mass >= 10 [kg] are now correctly parsed and the corresponding semantic objects are created in the constraint. Add actors compartment in UseCase and Requirement in the General View diagram. Handle the representation of actors on the General View diagram. Actors are represented with a stick figure image, with their label displayed below the image. Add support for edges between actors and their containing UseCase/Requirement in the General View diagram. The source of the edge (the UseCase or Requirement) can be reconnected to another UseCase or Requirement, but the target (Actor) cannot be reconnected. Allow to select existing RequirementUsage and RequirementDefinition on Objective tool. Add a check to make the build fail if a Cypress test contains it.only. Add support for public import in direct edit specializations. It is now possible to specialize an element with a qualified name containing namespaces importing the required features. For example, myAttribute : ISQ::MassValue now correctly types the attribute with ISQBase::MassValue. Improve the support of root Namespaces in SysON documents. Root Namespaces are now implicitly created at the root of SysON documents. Creating an element at the root of a SysON document now creates it in its root Namespace. A new filter is available to hide root Namespaces and is enabled by default. It is no longer possible to create Namespace from the explorer. It is no longer possible to create a representation on a root Namespace. Improve the drop from the explorer to ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed. Display prefix keywords in labels of Definitions and Usages graphical nodes. Ensure that dropping an element from the explorer on the diagram reveals the corresponding node if it is already on the diagram and hidden. A warning message is now displayed when attempting to drop an element which is already displayed and visible in the target container. Ignore keywords order during direct edit of prefixes labels of Definitions and Usages graphical elements. DirectEdit on graphical node or list item authorized only to modify keywords which can be displayed in each label. Allow to drop a Definition from the explorer on an Usage on a diagram or in a list compartment to type it. Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package. Add \"Show/Hide Icons in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide icons in the diagrams (icons are not part of the SysMLv2 specification). Add new tools allowing to create an ExhibitState at the root of General View and StateTransition View. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. The selected State will be added to the diagram, not the new ExhibitState. Handle FlowConnectionUsage between PortUsages in Interconnection View. A new edge tool allows to create a flow between two ports. Add tools to set a Feature as composite or reference. Handle ItemUsage in Interconnection View and FlowConnectionUsage using items as their source/target. Add documentation property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a documentation for the selected element. This property widget will only handle the first documentation associated to the selected element. If no documentation is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a Documentation element and will associate it to the selected element. Add new \"New objects from text\" menu entry on elements in Explorer view, allowing to insert textual SysMLv2 as objects under the selected element. The menu entry shows a dialog with a textarea allowing to write or paste textual SysMLv2. A click on the Insert button converts the textual SysMLv2 into model elements and add them under the selected element. Improve the drag and drop of container elements to move their content. Handle implicit specializations from standard libraries for Usages/Definitions. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from users models in diagrams. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members from Standard Libraries in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from standard libraries in diagrams.

Add State and StateDefinition in the General View diagram. Add Transition source and target to Core properties in the Details view. All redefines references of the SysMLv2 metamodel have been implemented. The textual import running process have been improved. By default, end users don’t have to copy syside-cli.js near the syson-application jar anymore. The embedded syside-cli.js is copied in a system temp folder and executed from there (with node). But, if you encounter execution rights problem, you can still copy syside-cli.js in a place where you have the appropriate rights and use the org.eclipse.syson.syside.path application option. Property \"Typed by\" is now always visible in the Details view for Feature elements, even if the Feature doesn’t have a type yet. Rename creation tools for Start and Done actions (from Add Start/Done to New Start/Done) Reduce the default height of the Package node in diagrams Move Feature#direction in Core properties tab of the Details view Sort New Object menu entries Add Direct Edit tool in Control (ForkNode, JoinNode…​) nodes palettes Allow multiple occurrences of Start and Done actions in actions compartments. Rewrite textual import. It is still an experimental feature but should now be faster and accurate. Rewrite the addExistingElement tool.

Add integration test infrastructure Initial contribution of this documentation Handle the JoinNode, MergeNode, ForkNode, DecisionNode elements in actions compartments. Handle the ExhibitState elements in diagrams Add new documentation compartment on all existing nodes in all diagrams. Expanded Diagram and Model Support: We’ve significantly expanded our support for various views, including the addition of representations for use cases, occurrences, and allocations. This enhancement provides more comprehensive tools to visualize and manage SysML v2 models. This includes the addition of diagrams for use cases, occurrences, and allocations. Improved User Experience: We’ve improved how elements are displayed, particularly in terms of ports and compartments. These enhancements ensure a clearer and more intuitive user interface. Increased Stability and Reliability: We’ve addressed several key bugs and stability issues including fixing problems with diagrams and import capabilities. These improvements help maintain the integrity and accuracy of semantic data. First Export Capability: Our enhanced integration of SysIDE now supports better integration of the SysML v2 format. We’re now able to export projects in the standard textual format, facilitating easier data sharing and compatibility with other industry-standard tools. This promotes better data exchange and collaboration. The requirement-view diagram has been introduced by error in the last release. This diagram isn’t defined in the SysMLv2 specification. It has been deleted in this release. Switch to Sirius Web v2024.5.0 Switch to @ObeoNetwork/gantt-task-react 0.4.9 Add dependency to org.apache.commons.commons-text 1.10.0 The \"Add existing elements (recursive)\" has been modified to work on PartUsage. From Interconnection view diagram, attributes compartment has been added in children PartUsage nodes. No error is raised anymore when setting a valid new value (with primitive type) in the Details view. The body feature of a Comment remove now the \"/*\" and \"*/\" characters while importing a model from SysML textual format. All Memberships are now contained in their parent through ownedRelatedElement instead of ownedRelationship reference. Rename action from explorer is now renaming tree items as expected. EnumerationDefinition is now created with a default name. \"Add existing element (recursive)\" action has been updated to create child nodes for nested and owned usages at the root of the diagram. While importing some of the standard examples, there are no more exception mainly when some of examples are linked to non resolved elements. Hide capabilities have been restored and improved in the palette. It’s now possible to hide a node but also all its content (recursive) or simply direct content (Show valued content action). Namespace.getImportedMemberships method now prevents name collisions as stated in the specification (KerML 7.2.5.4 Imports). Non end Usages have been removed from AllocationDefinition ends compartment. Circular containment of nested parts including self containment are now forbidden. Time performance has been improved when using Become nested part edge creation tool. state transition and actions compartments are now available on StateDefinition and StateUsage node. Inherited features in compartments don’t display itself anymore. Add existing element (recursive) behavior has been modified to be more robust and avoid potential exception, mainly the display of nested domain-based edge on State transition view diagram. Composite usages are now forbidden inside PortDefinition/PortUsage. Composite usages are now forbidden inside AttributeDefinition/AttributeUsage. Explicit usage of node to call SysIDE JavaScript file has been added. Membership#visibility attribute has been added to Core properties in the Details view. PortUsage#direction attribute has been added to Core properties in the Details view. Definition/Usage node are now collapsed by default in General view & Action Flow View diagrams. Definition/Usage nodes are expanded in all diagrams when a compartment item is created. All elements are now represented with their icon. Label is now positioned from inside to outside for Ports (Border Nodes). General view diagrams can now be created on any Namespace element. Instead of revealing all compartments of a node when user creates a child in one compartment, only the compartment parent of the child to create is revealed. Other compartments visibility doesn’t change. It’s now possible to create Interconnection view diagrams on any Usage/Definition element. A new compartment with a free-form layout inside the ActionUsage and ActionDefinition nodes is now available. Thanks to this compartment, user can separate Action nodes and connect them by using edges. Remove button is now available on containment edges. \"Add existing elements\" tools have been added on State and StateDefinition graphical elements. Compartments of RequirementDefinition and RequirementUsage have been redesigned to better fit the specification and examples. \"Become nested\" edge creation tools has been added for AttributeUsage, ItemUsage, PartUsage and PortUsage nodes. Creation tools (mainly AttributeUsage, PartUsage, PortUsage ItemUsage) have been added in ActionUsage, ConstraintUsage, InterfaceDefinition, RequirementDefinition and PortUsage. UseCaseDefinition and UseCaseUsage elements are now handled in General view. Composite edges between Usage and compartment content have been added to link nested Actions with its Action, nested Constraints with its Constraints and nested Constraints with its Requirement. OccurrenceDefinition and OccurrenceUsage elements are now handled in General view. Reconnection tools have been added for composition edges.

It’s now possible to represent and handle Succession edges between Actions in General view diagram, from background diagram but also from action flow compartment. Improved User Interactivity: New features such as direct editing allow users to change element details seamlessly, without data loss. This enhances the overall user experience by making it more intuitive and reducing the time required to make changes. Expanded Library and Standard Support: All KerML and SysML v2 standard libraries are now included by default. This expands the tool’s capabilities and ensures compatibility with industry standards, making it easier to integrate and reference standard elements in projects. Advanced Filtering: New filters have been added to the Explorer view, allowing users to hide specific elements and libraries, which simplifies the interface and focuses on relevant data. Import Capabilities: Additionally, SysML v2 textual files can now be imported directly, enhancing data integration and compatibility with other tools. Enhanced Diagram Development: We’ve restructured and streamlined our diagrams implementation, including the introduction of specific modules and tools for better cross-diagram functionality. This ensures that all graphical representations are more cohesive and easier to maintain. Node Descriptions Providers in General View has been modified with mainly rename of these providers to match with all Definitions and Usages Node Descriptions. After switch to Sirius Web v2024.3.0, GeneralViewRegistryConfigurer has been renamed to GeneralViewDescriptionProvider. SysMLv2ObjectService has been renamed into SysMLv2LabelService as it now implements ILabelServiceDelegate instead of IObjectServiceDelegate. Refactor diagrams code with creation of the diagram-common-view module to gather all cross diagram tools and there is now one name generator per diagram owning the diagram prefix used to prefix all descriptions for this diagram. commons-io 2.11.0 dependency has been explicitly added in syson-application-configuration. Switch to Sirius Web v2024.3.0 By activating direct Edit, User can now change the name/type/value/range of an element without any lost. The direct edit of labels in diagrams now handles partial edition. When user wants to create new elements under a selected element, only provides candidates that will make sense are proposed among new objects candidates in Explorer view menu. The creation of elements with their containing Membership is now done in one click. A recursive version of the Add existing elements tool is now available to display all the cluster of objects contained in a selected node. Package node headers' width has been improved to better handle longer labels. It’s now impossible to have Package children overlapping the Package node body’s west border. All KerML and SysML standard libraries have been added in project definition. These libraries aren’t visible in the Explorer. Users can reference these libraries elements from the Details view or through the direct edit of elements in diagrams. Tools names have been renamed by adding spaces between type words and removing \"Usage\" from tool names. User can now create elements inside list compartments via the containing node’s palette and the new element is created inside the correct compartment. General View diagram palette has been reorganized. New tool sections have been added to group semantically node tools by creation concept. In the Details view, standard libraries are now displayed in Reference Widget’s model browser dialog. getAllReachable() util service used to retrieve the elements of a given type has been improved to reduce its time execution. FeatureTyping Edge creation tool has been added to set the type of a Usage. Add kind property from RequirementConstraintMembership on Constraint core properties.

By following these instructions, you’ll configure your local environment with all required dependencies, tools, and services, enabling you to develop, test, and troubleshoot the product effectively on your own machine. SysON uses PostgreSQL as its database. For development or local testing, the simplest approach is to initiate a PostgreSQL instance using Docker. docker run -p 5433:5432 --name syson-postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd \\ -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db \\ -d postgres For Windows users, here is the same command on one line: docker run -p 5433:5432 --name syson-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db -d postgres This may take a while the first time you run this as Docker will first pull the PostgreSQL image. If you don’t have Docker or prefer to use an existing PostgreSQL installation, modify the following command-line parameters and ensure the POSTGRES_USER possesses administrative rights on the database. These rights are necessary for the automatic creation of the database schema. To run the application, you’ll need to use the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to execute the pre-build JAR (org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar) you downloaded earlier. Go to the folder containing the org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar and run the command:\" java -jar path\\to\\your\\syson-application-YEAR.MONTH.0.jar \\ --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/syson-db \\ --spring.datasource.username=dbuser \\ --spring.datasource.password=dbpwd Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to experience SysON. To end your local testing session, ensure you stop the running PostgreSQL Docker container using the command docker kill syson-postgres. Please note that this will erase all the data you have generated during testing. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the troubleshooting guide for detailed solutions.

It’s possible to turn-off and turn-on the synchronization between the Project Explorer and the current selection in the Project Editor. When synchronization is enabled, if you selects an element inside a representation, the Project Explorer view will ensure that the corresponding semantic element is visible and selected. This can require expanding new tree items which were previously not visible or scrolling the Project Explorer’s view. When moving between elements in a representation, this can quickly result in an Project Explorer view with many tree items expanded, which can be confusing. The Synchronize toggle button in the Project Explorer can be used to disable this synchronization.

The SysON supports a subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax, which allows you to update several elements simultaneously. This makes it more efficient to edit models. In general, you can edit the label of a shape in a diagram, and the diagram editor tries to interpret your input and update the corresponding element properties. If an element has a complex name such as someElementName[x]:someTypeName:>someElement, when editing, you must retain all the written parts; otherwise, you risk unsetting some values. Here are some shortcuts for efficiently editing SysON models: Typing someName updates the name of the selected element. Typing <someShortName> updates the short name of the selected element. If someShortName is empty (i.e. when typing <>) the short name of the selected element is deleted. Typing :SomeTypeName, sets the type of the selected element to SomeTypeName. If SomeTypeName doesn’t exist, it’s created as an appropriate type element (for example Item Definition, Part Definition, …​) within the same parent container as the selected element. Typing [x] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to x. Typing [1..x] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to 1..x. Typing [x..*] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to x..*. Typing someElement:>otherElement on a element sets someElement as a subsetting of the otherElement if both element are of the same type. Otherwise, it creates a specialization relationship between someElement and otherElement. Typing someElement:>>otherElement on an element sets someElement as a redefinition of otherElement. These shortcuts offer a convenient way to update model elements efficiently.","title":"Model management","component":"syson","version":"v2024.11.0","name":"model-management","url":"/syson/v2024.11.0/user-manual/hands-on/how-tos/model-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Due to the high volume of temporary files generated by SysON applications, antivirus software can significantly impact performance by causing excessive disk I/O and resource contention. In some cases, even disabling antivirus software might not be sufficient to resolve performance issues. In such situations, you may need to restart the server or completely uninstall the antivirus software. Here are some specific recommendations for configuring antivirus software for use with SysON server: Exclude SysON Application Folders from Scanning: Identify the installation directory of your SysON application and exclude it from regular antivirus scans. This will minimize the impact of antivirus scanning on SysON performance. Schedule Scanning Times: If possible, schedule antivirus scans during off-peak hours when SysON usage is minimal. This will reduce the likelihood of performance degradation during active usage periods. Configure Real-time Scanning: Adjust real-time scanning settings to minimize the impact on SysON performance. Consider disabling real-time scanning for specific SysON processes or files that are known to cause performance issues. Monitor Resource Utilization: Continuously monitor resource utilization, especially CPU and disk I/O, to identify any potential bottlenecks caused by antivirus software. Adjust scanning settings or consider uninstalling the antivirus software if it significantly impacts SysON performance. Consult with Antivirus Vendor: If you continue to experience performance issues despite optimizing antivirus settings, consider contacting the antivirus vendor for specific guidance on configuring their software for optimal compatibility with SysON applications. Remember, the goal is to achieve a balance between comprehensive antivirus protection and minimizing its impact on SysON performance. By carefully configuring antivirus settings and monitoring resource utilization, you can ensure that your SysON server operates smoothly while maintaining a robust security posture.","title":"Configure Anti-virus software for use with SysON server","component":"syson","version":"v2024.7.0","name":"anti-virus","url":"/syson/v2024.7.0/installation-guide/anti-virus.html","titles":[]},"101":{"id":101,"text":"Before diving into the installation process, it’s crucial to understand the underlying architecture of SysON.

Take a moment to review and align your system with the recommended specifications outlined after to offer a smooth installation and a robust user experience. If a platform and version isn’t listed on this page, it implies that this platform and version isn’t tested, bugs fixed, or provided help for. Before diving into the installation process, it’s crucial to understand the underlying architecture of SysON. This section provides a detailed overview of the system’s components, their interactions, and the overall design principles. SysON is a web application, meaning it runs centrally on a server, and users interact with it through web browsers from any computer on the same network. There is one primary method for installing SysON, following the classical client-server model: The server computer runs the SysON Server, N client computers run the SysON Clients. To set up the SysON Server, it’s crucial to meet the specific prerequisites that lay the groundwork for a stable and reliable server environment. Hardware For a small number of projects, less or equal to 10, and about 10-30 users, 100k semantic elements and 1000 representations in total: a recent server featuring a multi-core CPU clocked at 2 GHz and equipped with 4 GB of available RAM, along with a reasonably fast hard drive, 7200 Revolutions Per Minute - RPM or faster, should cater for your needs. Required RAM: 4 GB Recommended RAM 8 GB or more Required CPU: Dual-core processor Recommended CPU: Quad-core processor Disk space: 10 GB for installation Supplementary disk space for application data To enhance performance further, it’s advisable to follow SysON memory usage and assign more memory as needed. In scenarios where your system anticipates a large volume of concurrent requests, deploying SysON applications on a multi-core CPU machine becomes helpful. This strategy increases the concurrency of processing requests, leading to improved response times for your users. Adjusting memory allocation and leveraging multi-core capabilities contribute to optimizing the all system responsiveness. For more information, you can also see Scaling SysON. Operating system SysON operates purely on Java and should function on any supported operating system, given that it meets the JDK / JRE requirements. Linux 64-bit, preferable distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Windows Server 64-bit, recommended versions include Windows Server 2016 or later : Read antivirus in SysON applications. Database To connect your SysON instance to an enterprise database, you must install and configure one of the following supported databases: PostgreSQL 15 Verify that the server has a dedicated PostgreSQL database with administrator rights. Java Runtime Environment - JRE You need to install and configure a separate JRE to run SysON, you have to install a supported version of the Java runtime: Use Java 17 to run the SysON Server. It’s recommended to use the Java runtime provided by the Eclipse Temurin project. Network Connectivity Stable internet connection for updates and communication with SysON Clients. SysON is browser-based software, which means you can run SysON on all full desktop operating systems : MacOS, Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS. Users can interact with the central server through following web browsers: Desktop browsers: Chrome latest stable version Mozilla Firefox latest stable version Mobile browsers: Note that SysON isn’t supported on mobile devices. SysON doesn’t support Internet Explorer. SysON supports a minimal screen resolution of 1024 * 768 with maximized browsers. The minimal operating system - OS requirements are: Windows 10 or later Apple macOS 13.x Ventura and later Any Linux operating system that supports the browsers mentioned earlier Any Chrome operating system that supports the browsers mentioned earlier You can find out what browser and operating system version you have on What’s my Browser. A plugin, add-on, or extension that you have installed in your browser could cause speed, upload, download, or various interface problem with SysON. To see if this is the case you can try disabling all plugins, add-ons, or extensions within your browser. You should aim to offer a network with the lowest possible latency between the client and the server. To get optimal performance, it’s strongly recommend hosting both the server and database on the same physical server to reduce latency between the two components. Virtual Private Network - VPN aren’t recommended. It’s a common latency factor such as other network elements that could drop connections that are more or less inactive. As such wireless connection are also not recommended as any loss of connectivity might lead to instability in the product and loss of data. If a network element of this kind is mandatory, use an SSH tunnel as a workaround to avoid client/server disconnections. SysON should be the unique way to edit the information stored in the database. SysON isn’t warranted to run without any error or interruption. We don’t make any warranty about the statements that are under the section Deployment recommendations, it’s for information purposes.

Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof. “Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy. “Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files. “Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works. b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3). 3. REQUIREMENTS 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then: a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3. 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code: a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement. Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice “This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.” Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

The cycle spans 8 weeks and includes three main phases: Development (4 Weeks): Focus: This phase is dedicated to actively working on new features, bug fixes, and enhancements. Activities: Contributors, including community members and core developers, work together to develop new functionalities, perform code reviews, and integrate changes. Collaboration and transparency are key during this phase. Stabilization and Feature Freeze (2 Weeks): Focus: We enter a feature freeze period where no new features are introduced. Activities: During this time, the focus shifts to thorough testing and stabilization of the new features. This ensures the software’s quality and reliability. Any remaining issues or bugs are addressed to prepare for the release. Cool Down and Planning (2 Weeks): Focus: This phase involves wrapping up the current cycle and preparing for the next one. Activities: Contributors work on upgrading dependencies, resolving minor issues, and documenting the latest changes. Additionally, the team discusses and plans the features and tasks for the next cycle, ensuring a smooth transition. The General Availability (GA) release of SysON occurs on the eighteenth week of each development cycle. Being an open source project, SysON thrives on community participation and collaboration. Here’s how the team is organized: * Core Developers: these are the primary maintainers who oversee the project’s direction, manage releases, and ensure code quality. * Contributors: this includes anyone from the community who contributes code, documentation, or ideas. Contributions are reviewed and merged by core developers. * Community: a diverse group of users, testers, and enthusiasts who provide feedback, report bugs, and propose new features. This collaborative approach allows SysON to continuously evolve while maintaining a high standard of quality and performance. If you’re interested in contributing or have any questions, feel free to join the community discussions or contact us. SysON adheres to a CalVer (Calendar Versioning) strategy to communicate the timeline and stability of its releases. The versioning follows a YEAR.MONTH.PATCH format, where: YEAR.MONTH.0: These are the stable releases, marking significant milestones or major updates. For example, a version like 2024.5.0 indicates a stable release from May 2024. Intermediate Releases: Between the .0 versions, there may be multiple intermediate releases, denoted by increasing the PATCH number (for example 2024.5.1, 2024.5.2). These are intended to provide updates, fixes, and incremental improvements leading up to the next stable release. Stable versions (.0 versions) are recommended for production environments, while intermediate versions offer early access to new features and fixes but might undergo further changes before the next stable release. This strategy ensures that users can rely on a predictable and transparent update cycle, aligning with the continuous evolution and enhancement of SysON.

Detailed explanations walk you through each step. The easiest and most straightforward method to install SysON using Docker Compose, which automatically installs Java and PostgreSQL. Before you proceed with the installation, please ensure you have the following prerequisites: Docker installed. SysON is distributed as a docker container. To install SysON, just download the docker-compose file and run the following docker command in the same folder as the one where is the docker-compose.yml file: docker compose up This method installs SysON (matching the version tagged in this documentation) along with a PostgreSQL database, all within a Docker container. To install a specific version vYYYY.MM.0, edit the docker-compose.yml file and replace the tagged version with your desired version. For example, update the following line in the docker-compose.yml: app: image: \"${IMAGE_TAG:-eclipsesyson/syson:*vYYYY.MM.0*}\" All accessible versions of SysON as Docker containers are listed in the SysON Docker registry. Once your Docker up, please go directly to the Open your web browser section! Detailed instructions for manually setting up SysON, including PostgreSQL installation with Docker, downloading the JAR application, and starting it manually. Before you proceed with the installation, please ensure you have the following prerequisites: Java supported version Docker installed, or an existing supported database installation with a user that has administrator privileges. SysON is distributed as a single executable Java Archive JAR which contains the complete SysON application along with all its dependencies. This distribution simplifies the setup process, enabling convenient exploration of SysON’s features. Stable versions Only YEAR.MONTH.0 versions are stable and suitable for production deployments. Other versions, such as intermediate releases, are intended solely for testing purposes. They’re not recommended for production use due to their potential for further changes and instability. Always use the stable .0 releases for any production environments to ensure reliability and support. For more details see SysON development cycle. To download the latest pre-built JAR for SysON, follow these steps: Before you begin the installation process, navigate to the download page for org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar to access all versions. Identify the SysON latest available version for download. Click the latest version to open its specific page. In the Assets section, locate the JAR file named org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar. Click the JAR file to start the download to your local machine. This process ensures that you get the most recent version of the SysON application in the form of a pre-built JAR file. SysON uses PostgreSQL as its database. For development or local testing, the simplest approach is to initiate a PostgreSQL instance using Docker. docker run -p 5434:5432 --name syson-postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd \\ -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db \\ -d postgres For Windows users, here is the same command on one line: docker run -p 5434:5432 --name syson-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db -d postgres This may take a while the first time you run this as Docker will first pull the PostgreSQL image. If you don’t have Docker or prefer to use an existing PostgreSQL installation, modify the following command-line parameters and ensure the POSTGRES_USER possesses administrative rights on the database. These rights are necessary for the automatic creation of the database schema. To run the application, you’ll need to use the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to execute the pre-build JAR (org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar) you downloaded earlier. Go to the folder containing the org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar and run the command:\" java -jar path\\to\\your\\syson-application-YEAR.MONTH.0.jar \\ --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5434/syson-db \\ --spring.datasource.username=dbuser \\ --spring.datasource.password=dbpwd Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to experience SysON. To end your local testing session, ensure you stop the running PostgreSQL Docker container using the command docker kill syson-postgres. Please note that this will erase all the data you have generated during testing. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the troubleshooting guide for detailed solutions.

The General view is employed to display any members of exposed model elements. it’s the most general view, enabling presentation of any model element. This view in SysON is implemented as an unsynchronized diagram. This means that users need to manually add existing elements to the diagram to visualize them. It doesn’t display all the information stored in the model by default. User can create General view diagram on any element provided it inherits from Namespace type. The Diagram panel has global actions grouped in a horizontal toolbar underneath the diagram tabs. This toolbar has the following actions: Display full screen, Fit selection to screen, Zoom group: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Share the diagram link, Export diagram as SVG, Toggle snap to grid, Show helper line to align elements, Arrange all elements, Reveal hidden elements, Reveal faded elements, Unpin all elements. Six categories of elements can be represented on General view diagram. The following Definition elements can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Definition, Allocation Definition, Attribute Definition, Constraint Definition, Enumeration Definition, Interface Definition, Item Definition, Metadata Definition, Occurrence Definition, Part Definition, Port Definition, Requirement Definition, UseCase Definition. Definition elements are represented by rectangular node style. Keyword with \"Def\" specification is defined in the label of the node. The following Usage elements can be displayed in the General view diagram: Accept Action usage, Action Usage, Allocation Usage, Attribute Usage, Constraint Usage, Interface Usage, Item Usage, Occurrence Usage, Part Usage, Port Usage, Requirement Usage, UseCase Usage. Usage elements are represented by rectangular node style with rounded corner. The following element in Definition compartments can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Definition can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action, Attribute in Attribute Definition/Interface Definition/Item Definition/Metadata Definition/Occurrence Definition/Part Definition/Port Definition/Requirement Definition, Constraint in Constraint Definition, Enumerated Value in Enumeration Definition, Interface in Interface Definition, Port in Interface Definition/Part Definition, Reference in Metadata Definition/Port Definition, Occurence in Occurrence Definition, Assumed Constraint in Requirement Definition, Required Constraint in Requirement Definition. Each element in Definition nodes are represented in dedicated compartment. A Definition node can have several compartments if Definition element can contain many kind of element. Each compartment is distinguished by a specific identifier. The following element in Usage compartments can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Usage can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action, Item in Action Usage, Allocation in Allocation Usage, Attribute in Attribute Usage/Interface Usage/Item Usage/Part Usage/Port Usage/Requirement Usage, Reference in Attribute Usage/Item Usage/Port Usage, Constraint in Constraint Usage, Port in Interface Usage/Part Usage, Occurrence in Occurrence Usage, Assumed Constraint in Requirement Usage, Required constraint in Requirement Usage. Each element in Definition nodes are represented in dedicated compartment. A Definition node can have several compartments if Definition element can contain many kind of element. Each compartment is distinguished by a specific identifier. Package element can be represented on General view diagram. Its represented by a folder and its label has the keyword package. The following Relationship can be displayed in the General view diagram: Dependency, Subclassification, Redefinition, Subsetting, Feature Typing, Allocation, Containment relation, Succession. User can create element from the background of the diagram from a simple click that displays toolbar. In this toolbar, element creation tool are grouped by type in tool section according to their type. User can expand the tool section and then user can click on the desired creation tool User can also create element in other element. User just clicks on the element to display the toolbar and then click on the desired creation tool. All created element are collapsed by default, it means that if a node with compartment is created, compartment are hidden. If node contains compartment, user can add element in the desired compartment by clicking in the compartment and display the toolbar. An other way is to click on the parent node header of the compartment. A toolbar will be display and the user can click on the desired creation tool, new element will be created in the appropriate compartment. User can only delete a graphical element from the diagram without removing it from the model. User should just click on Delete from diagram button in the palette. User can also remove element from model (and so from diagram) by clicking on Delete from model button in the palette. A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the Delete from model tool in the palette or via the Model Explorer. This behavior can be disabled by checking the \"Disable this confirmation dialog\" checkbox in the dialog. This preference is stored in the local storage of the browser. You can reset it by deleting the SysON data in cache of your browser. Relationship Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge’s source and target types. If no edge creation is authorized with a given target, the target node appears faded. When user try to create an edge, user clicks first on the source element to display arrow border. Then user clicks on one of these arrows and stay click until the target. User can see the feedback of the edge and the target node is highlighted. After releasing the click, a pop-up appears and displays all possible kind of edge to create. If only one kind of edge is possible, the edge is directly create without opening the pop-up. it’s not possible for now to create an Edge between two Edges or between an Edge and a Node. Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element. If the new source or the new target isn’t allowed for reconnection, these one will be faded. To delete relationship from model, user should click on the edge and click on the delete button. Remember that relationship edge are always synchronized, it’s not possible to only delete relationship edge from diagram. Containment relationShip isn’t deletable from the diagram. Other relationship can be deletable from the diagram. Keywords on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label. For example Definition nodes will be prefixed with \"part def\" and Usage node with \"part\". After the keyword, the label can be the simple name of the element, or more complex in some specific cases. Indeed, For example, subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax is supported to describe some element. For simple Definition element, the label will display the keyword \"part def\" and its declared name. For elements using specialization, the label will display the kind of the specilalization. For example, if a Batmobile is a subclassification of Vehicle, its label will display the key word \"part def\" and then \"Batmobile :> Vehicle\" to show its specalization toward Vehicle. If Usage element is given by relationship with multiplicity, the multiplicity value (upper and lower bound) is specified between bracket in the label, just before the specialization. For example, for a Batmobile which contained 4 Wheel by using the Usage wheels then the label will be composed of the keyword \"part\" followed by the name wheels[4] : Wheel which described the Usage wheels with multiplicity 4 defined by the Definition Wheel. For element with compartment node (with list layout), the label of compartment node will be displayed in italic and it will only contained a simple name. No label is defined on edges except in two cases : allocation edge label is specified with its keyword allocate, edge which represent relationship with multiplicity have their multiplicity defined in their label (ex.: containment edge). Element labels can be edited in the following ways: Edit action of the Palette, Press F2, Type directly the new name. With direct edit, user can’t change the keyword but user can change the name. If it’s a simple label, he can rename the element. If user modify the multiplicity defined in the label then the multiplicity of the relationship is changed in the model. User can alos set/change the specialization of a given element. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for direct edit action Label of edges and compartments node can’t be edited. Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram. This drag and drop doesn’t perform any semantic modification. Diagrams also allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram. Note that it’s not possible to Drag and drop an element represented as an Edge on the diagram. User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node. Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded. When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted. From the diagram background or from a given node, it’s possible to display all existing elements contained by the initial selection. User just need to display the palette and unfold Existing elements section. User can click on Add existing elements to display elements directly contained by the selection. User can also click on Add existing elements (recursive) to display elements directly contained by the selection and elements contained by these elements and so on. When user select multiple elements, many actions are available to manage all selected element. After user selected some elements, a simplified toolbar is displayed. User can still used basic tools such as : Hide elements, Fade elements, Pin elements. A new tool section appears in this toolbar. Many tools acting on selected elements layout can be found in this tool section : Align left, Align center, Align right, Align top, Align middle, Align bottom, Arrange in row, Arrange in column, Arrange in grid, Distribute horizontal spacing, Distribute vertical spacing, Justify horizontally, Justify vertically, Make same size. In addition to toolbar actions, some actions can be execute with shortcuts. Indeed, after user selected some elements, user can press the key \"Del\" to remove all selected elements. User can also move all selected element on the diagram without changing its graphical or semantic parent.","title":"General view","component":"syson","version":"v2024.7.0","name":"general-view","url":"/syson/v2024.7.0/user-manual/features/general-view.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The Interconnection view is used to show encapsulated structural contents of _Usage- element: Parts, Properties, Connectors, Ports, and Interfaces. This view in SysON is implemented as an unsynchronized diagram. This means that users need to manually add existing elements to the diagram to visualize them. It doesn’t display all the information stored in the model by default. User can create Interconnection view on any Usage or Definition element. The Diagram panel has global actions grouped in a horizontal toolbar underneath the diagram tabs. This toolbar has the following actions: Display full screen, Fit selection to screen, Zoom group: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Share the diagram link, Export diagram as SVG, Toggle snap to grid, Show helper line to align elements, Arrange all elements, Reveal hidden elements, Reveal faded elements, Unpin all elements. From the root Usage, two elements can be displayed in the Interconnection view diagram: Usage part, port. From compartment of Usage part, three elements can be displayed in the Interconnection view diagram: attribute part port The following Relationship can be displayed in the General view diagram: Binding connector as Usage, Allocation, User can create element from the background of the diagram from a simple click that displays toolbar. In this toolbar, element creation tool are grouped by type in tool section according to their type. User can expand the tool section and then user can click on the desired creation tool User can also create element in other element. User just clicks on the element to display the toolbar and then click on the desired creation tool. All created element are collapsed by default, it means that if a node with compartment is created, compartment are hidden. If node contains compartment, user can add element in the desired compartment by clicking in the compartment and display the toolbar. An other way is to click on the parent node header of the compartment. A toolbar will be display and the user can click on the desired creation tool, new element will be created in the appropriate compartment. User can only delete a graphical element from the diagram without removing it from the model. User should just click on Delete from diagram button in the palette. User can also remove element from model (and so from diagram) by clicking on Delete from model button in the palette. A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the Delete from model tool in the palette or via the Model Explorer. This behavior can be disabled by checking the \"Disable this confirmation dialog\" checkbox in the dialog. This preference is stored in the local storage of the browser. You can reset it by deleting the SysON data in cache of your browser. Relationship Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge’s source and target types. If no edge creation is authorized with a given target, the target node appears faded. When user try to create an edge, user clicks first on the source element to display arrow border. Then user clicks on one of these arrows and stay click until the target. User can see the feedback of the edge and the target node is highlighted. After releasing the click, a pop-up appears and displays all possible kind of edge to create. If only one kind of edge is possible, the edge is directly create without opening the pop-up. it’s not possible for now to create an Edge between two Edges or between an Edge and a Node. Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element. If the new source or the new target isn’t allowed for reconnection, these one will be faded. To delete relationship from model, user should click on the edge and click on the delete button. Remember that relationship edge are always synchronized, it’s not possible to only delete relationship edge from diagram. Containment relationShip isn’t deletable from the diagram. Other relationship can be deletable from the diagram. Keywords on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label. For example Definition nodes will be prefixed with \"part def\" and Usage node with \"part\". After the keyword, the label can be the simple name of the element, or more complex in some specific cases. Indeed, For example, subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax is supported to describe some element. For simple Definition element, the label will display the keyword \"part def\" and its declared name. For elements using specialization, the label will display the kind of the specilalization. For example, if a Batmobile is a subclassification of Vehicle, its label will display the key word \"part def\" and then \"Batmobile :> Vehicle\" to show its specalization toward Vehicle. If Usage element is given by relationship with multiplicity, the multiplicity value (upper and lower bound) is specified between bracket in the label, just before the specialization. For example, for a Batmobile which contained 4 Wheel by using the Usage wheels then the label will be composed of the keyword \"part\" followed by the name wheels[4] : Wheel which described the Usage wheels with multiplicity 4 defined by the Definition Wheel. For element with compartment node (with list layout), the label of compartment node will be displayed in italic and it will only contained a simple name. No label is defined on edges except in two cases : allocation edge label is specified with its keyword allocate, edge which represent relationship with multiplicity have their multiplicity defined in their label (ex.: containment edge). Element labels can be edited in the following ways: Edit action of the Palette, Press F2, Type directly the new name. With direct edit, user can’t change the keyword but user can change the name. If it’s a simple label, he can rename the element. If user modify the multiplicity defined in the label then the multiplicity of the relationship is changed in the model. User can alos set/change the specialization of a given element. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for direct edit action Label of edges and compartments node can’t be edited. Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram. This drag and drop doesn’t perform any semantic modification. Diagrams also allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram. Note that it’s not possible to Drag and drop an element represented as an Edge on the diagram. User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node. Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded. When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted. From the diagram background or from a given node, it’s possible to display all existing elements contained by the initial selection. User just need to display the palette and unfold Existing elements section. User can click on Add existing elements to display elements directly contained by the selection. User can also click on Add existing elements (recursive) to display elements directly contained by the selection and elements contained by these elements and so on. When user select multiple elements, many actions are available to manage all selected element. After user selected some elements, a simplified toolbar is displayed. User can still used basic tools such as : Hide elements, Fade elements, Pin elements. A new tool section appears in this toolbar. Many tools acting on selected elements layout can be found in this tool section : Align left, Align center, Align right, Align top, Align middle, Align bottom, Arrange in row, Arrange in column, Arrange in grid, Distribute horizontal spacing, Distribute vertical spacing, Justify horizontally, Justify vertically, Make same size. In addition to toolbar actions, some actions can be execute with shortcuts. Indeed, after user selected some elements, user can press the key \"Del\" to remove all selected elements. User can also move all selected element on the diagram without changing its graphical or semantic parent.","title":"Interconnection view","component":"syson","version":"v2024.7.0","name":"interconnection-view","url":"/syson/v2024.7.0/user-manual/features/interconnection-view.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

However, understanding the scaling limits of the system is essential for planning and optimizing your usage to ensure performance and efficiency. Below, we outline the primary scaling factors and limitations related to model size, semantic elements, representations, project management, and user concurrency. Maximum Model Size: SysON is built to manage large models, but there are practical limits to its capacity. The system can efficiently handle models up to about 10 MB in size. Models larger than this might experience performance degradation, especially in terms of loading times and responsiveness. Impact on Performance: As model size increases, users might meet longer loading times and slower response rates when performing operations such as editing or navigating the model. It’s recommended to break down exceptionally large models into smaller, manageable sub-models where feasible. Element Capacity: SysON can manage models containing up to 150,000 semantic elements. These elements include elements, relationships, and attributes that define the structure and behavior of the model. Performance Considerations: Exceeding this number might lead to increased memory usage and slower query responses. For optimal performance, it’s advisable to maintain a balance and avoid overly complex models that push the upper limit of this capacity. Representation Limits: The system supports up to 2,000 distinct representations per project. Complexity and Usability: While the system can handle a high number of representations, maintaining a clear and organized structure is crucial. Overloading a project with too many representations can complicate navigation and reduce usability. Element Density: A single representation can display up to 1,000 elements. Beyond this, the representation might become cluttered, making it difficult to interpret and work with the visual data. Performance and Visualization: High-density representations may slow down rendering times and interaction speed. It’s beneficial to segment large visualizations into smaller, more focused views to maintain clarity and performance. Project Management: SysON can support up to 1,000 concurrent projects per server. This allows organizations to manage multiple initiatives simultaneously without significant performance degradation. Server Load: The number of projects impacts server load and resource allocation. While the system can support a high number of projects, each project adds to the computational and storage demands, so server capacity should be scaled so. User Capacity: The system is designed to support up to 80 concurrent users on a single server. This capacity ensures that people can collaborate in real-time without encountering significant slowdowns or access issues. Collaboration Dynamics: The performance of collaborative features, such as live editing and real-time updates, might vary depending on the number of users and the complexity of the operations being performed. For larger teams, it’s important to monitor server load and possibly segment users across multiple servers if necessary. Model Partitioning: To manage large models, consider breaking them down into smaller, modular sub-models. This can help maintain performance and make it easier to manage and navigate complex data. Efficient Representations: Limit the number of elements displayed in each representation to avoid clutter and maintain responsiveness. Use multiple, focused representations instead of one overloaded view. Scalable Infrastructure: Ensure that your server infrastructure is scalable to handle increases in project load and user concurrency. This might involve using cloud-based solutions that can dynamically allocate resources as needed. Regular Monitoring: Implement regular monitoring of system performance and user activity to identify and address potential bottlenecks. This can help maintain smooth operation even as the scale of use increases. Contact us for custom solutions: If your needs exceed the outlined limits or you require specific performance optimizations, please contact us. Our team can provide tailored solutions and advice to ensure that SysON meets your scaling requirements effectively.

In the context of Model-Based Systems Engineering - MBSE, where diverse teams contribute to different facets of a project, having an open source tool becomes a unifying force. It allows seamless collaboration and information exchange among stakeholders, regardless of their preferred tools or methodologies. SysON empowers users to seamlessly transition between graphical and textual representations, accommodating diverse modeling preferences and the specific demands of the systems under analysis. This flexibility is crucial in MBSE, where the ability to articulate and refine models in different modalities is instrumental in capturing the complexity inherent in modern system designs. The extensibility of SysML v2 within SysON is a key aspect that reinforces its adaptability to diverse industries and complex project landscapes. In MBSE, where each domain might have unique requirements and specifications, having a tool that can be tailored to meet these specific needs is invaluable. SysON’s extensibility ensures that it remains a dynamic and adaptable resource for system engineers working across various domains. As SysON evolves, guided by the principles of SysML v2, it positions itself as more than just a tool; it evolves into a comprehensive and standardized environment for MBSE endeavors. The commitment to open source and interoperability serves as a cornerstone for future developments, ensuring that SysON continues to meet the evolving needs of the MBSE community. In essence, SysON stands as an open source enabler, promoting collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability—fundamental principles in the ever-evolving landscape of MBSE. SysON extends its utility by introducing the capability to import and export projects in JSON format. This feature enhances interoperability, allowing users to seamlessly exchange project data and collaborate with external tools or platforms. SysON doesn’t support the SysML v2 Standard JSON format for import/export. For detailed instructions on downloading projects, downloading models, uploading projects, and uploading models, please refer to the respective sections in the documentation. These sections provide step-by-step guidance on how to perform these actions within the SysON environment. SysON support SysML v2 textual specifications as an exchange format in order facilitate smooth transitions between tools. This intent reflects SysON’s dedication to staying aligned with evolving industry standards. Add-on has been developed to enable import/export capability to and from SysML v2 textual syntax. This feature provides users with additional flexibility in their modeling workflows. Before importing a file, you need to make sure that all the dependences of this file are also imported, and this, recursively. Otherwise some relationship won’t be resolved. For example if you want to import a file that uses third party libraries, you will need to import the third party libraries before the actual file, otherwise you might have unreferenced relations. Most important SysML v2 concepts can be translated from the imported file, some concept are still under development to enable complete import/export capability from and to SysML v2 textual syntax. Stay tuned for updates on its availability in the project. The following example shows an example of SysML v2 content file to import: package PictureTaking { part def Exposure; action def Focus { out xrsl: Exposure; } action def Shoot { in xsf: Exposure; } action takePicture { action focus: Focus[1]; flow focus.xrsl to shoot.xsf; action shoot: Shoot[1]; } }","title":"Interoperability","component":"syson","version":"v2024.7.0","name":"interoperability","url":"/syson/v2024.7.0/user-manual/integration/interoperability.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The SysON supports a subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax, which allows you to update several elements simultaneously. This makes it more efficient to edit models. In general, you can edit the label of a shape in a diagram, and the diagram editor tries to interpret your input and update the corresponding element properties. If an element has a complex name such as someElementName[x]:someTypeName:>someElement, when editing, you must retain all the written parts; otherwise, you risk unsetting some values. Here are some shortcuts for efficiently editing SysON models: Typing someName updates the name of the selected element. Typing :SomeTypeName, sets the type of the selected element to SomeTypeName. If SomeTypeName doesn’t exist, it’s created as an appropriate type element (for example Item Definition, Part Definition, …​) within the same parent container as the selected element. Typing [x] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to x. Typing [1..x] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to 1..x. Typing [x..*] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to x..*. Typing someElement:>otherElement on a element sets someElement as a subsetting of the otherElement if both element are of the same type. Otherwise, it creates a specialization relationship between someElement and otherElement. Typing someElement:>>otherElement on an element sets someElement as a redefinition of otherElement. These shortcuts offer a convenient way to update model elements efficiently.","title":"Model management","component":"syson","version":"v2024.7.0","name":"model-management","url":"/syson/v2024.7.0/user-manual/hands-on/how-tos/model-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It’s possible to turn-off and turn-on the synchronization between the Project Explorer and the current selection in the Project Editor. When synchronization is enabled, if you selects an element inside a representation, the Project Explorer view will ensure that the corresponding semantic element is visible and selected. This can require expanding new tree items which were previously not visible or scrolling the Project Explorer’s view. When moving between elements in a representation, this can quickly result in an Project Explorer view with many tree items expanded, which can be confusing.

Due to the high volume of temporary files generated by SysON applications, antivirus software can significantly impact performance by causing excessive disk I/O and resource contention. In some cases, even disabling antivirus software might not be sufficient to resolve performance issues. In such situations, you may need to restart the server or completely uninstall the antivirus software. Here are some specific recommendations for configuring antivirus software for use with SysON server: Exclude SysON Application Folders from Scanning: Identify the installation directory of your SysON application and exclude it from regular antivirus scans. This will minimize the impact of antivirus scanning on SysON performance. Schedule Scanning Times: If possible, schedule antivirus scans during off-peak hours when SysON usage is minimal. This will reduce the likelihood of performance degradation during active usage periods. Configure Real-time Scanning: Adjust real-time scanning settings to minimize the impact on SysON performance. Consider disabling real-time scanning for specific SysON processes or files that are known to cause performance issues. Monitor Resource Utilization: Continuously monitor resource utilization, especially CPU and disk I/O, to identify any potential bottlenecks caused by antivirus software. Adjust scanning settings or consider uninstalling the antivirus software if it significantly impacts SysON performance. Consult with Antivirus Vendor: If you continue to experience performance issues despite optimizing antivirus settings, consider contacting the antivirus vendor for specific guidance on configuring their software for optimal compatibility with SysON applications. Remember, the goal is to achieve a balance between comprehensive antivirus protection and minimizing its impact on SysON performance. By carefully configuring antivirus settings and monitoring resource utilization, you can ensure that your SysON server operates smoothly while maintaining a robust security posture.","title":"Configure Anti-virus software for use with SysON server","component":"syson","version":"v2024.9.0","name":"anti-virus","url":"/syson/v2024.9.0/installation-guide/anti-virus.html","titles":[]},"179":{"id":179,"text":"Before diving into the installation process, it’s crucial to understand the underlying architecture of SysON.

Take a moment to review and align your system with the recommended specifications outlined after to offer a smooth installation and a robust user experience. If a platform and version isn’t listed on this page, it implies that this platform and version isn’t tested, bugs fixed, or provided help for. Before diving into the installation process, it’s crucial to understand the underlying architecture of SysON. This section provides a detailed overview of the system’s components, their interactions, and the overall design principles. SysON is a web application, meaning it runs centrally on a server, and users interact with it through web browsers from any computer on the same network. There is one primary method for installing SysON, following the classical client-server model: The server computer runs the SysON Server, N client computers run the SysON Clients. To set up the SysON Server, it’s crucial to meet the specific prerequisites that lay the groundwork for a stable and reliable server environment. Hardware For a small number of projects, less or equal to 10, and about 10-30 users, 100k semantic elements and 1000 representations in total: a recent server featuring a multi-core CPU clocked at 2 GHz and equipped with 4 GB of available RAM, along with a reasonably fast hard drive, 7200 Revolutions Per Minute - RPM or faster, should cater for your needs. Required RAM: 4 GB Recommended RAM 8 GB or more Required CPU: Dual-core processor Recommended CPU: Quad-core processor Disk space: 10 GB for installation Supplementary disk space for application data To enhance performance further, it’s advisable to follow SysON memory usage and assign more memory as needed. In scenarios where your system anticipates a large volume of concurrent requests, deploying SysON applications on a multi-core CPU machine becomes helpful. This strategy increases the concurrency of processing requests, leading to improved response times for your users. Adjusting memory allocation and leveraging multi-core capabilities contribute to optimizing the all system responsiveness. For more information, you can also see Scaling SysON. Operating system SysON operates purely on Java and should function on any supported operating system, given that it meets the JDK / JRE requirements. Linux 64-bit, preferable distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Windows Server 64-bit, recommended versions include Windows Server 2016 or later : Read antivirus in SysON applications. Database To connect your SysON instance to an enterprise database, you must install and configure one of the following supported databases: PostgreSQL 15 Verify that the server has a dedicated PostgreSQL database with administrator rights. Java Runtime Environment - JRE You need to install and configure a separate JRE to run SysON, you have to install a supported version of the Java runtime: Use Java 17 to run the SysON Server. It’s recommended to use the Java runtime provided by the Eclipse Temurin project. Network Connectivity Stable internet connection for updates and communication with SysON Clients. SysON is browser-based software, which means you can run SysON on all full desktop operating systems : MacOS, Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS. Users can interact with the central server through following web browsers: Desktop browsers: Chrome latest stable version Mozilla Firefox latest stable version Mobile browsers: Note that SysON isn’t supported on mobile devices. SysON doesn’t support Internet Explorer. SysON supports a minimal screen resolution of 1024 * 768 with maximized browsers. The minimal operating system - OS requirements are: Windows 10 or later Apple macOS 13.x Ventura and later Any Linux operating system that supports the browsers mentioned earlier Any Chrome operating system that supports the browsers mentioned earlier You can find out what browser and operating system version you have on What’s my Browser. A plugin, add-on, or extension that you have installed in your browser could cause speed, upload, download, or various interface problem with SysON. To see if this is the case you can try disabling all plugins, add-ons, or extensions within your browser. You should aim to offer a network with the lowest possible latency between the client and the server. To get optimal performance, it’s strongly recommend hosting both the server and database on the same physical server to reduce latency between the two components. Virtual Private Network - VPN aren’t recommended. It’s a common latency factor such as other network elements that could drop connections that are more or less inactive. As such wireless connection are also not recommended as any loss of connectivity might lead to instability in the product and loss of data. If a network element of this kind is mandatory, use an SSH tunnel as a workaround to avoid client/server disconnections. SysON should be the unique way to edit the information stored in the database. SysON isn’t warranted to run without any error or interruption. We don’t make any warranty about the statements that are under the section Deployment recommendations, it’s for information purposes.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then: a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3. 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code: a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement. Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice “This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.” Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses. If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

The cycle spans 8 weeks and includes three main phases: Development (4 Weeks): Focus: This phase is dedicated to actively working on new features, bug fixes, and enhancements. Activities: Contributors, including community members and core developers, work together to develop new functionalities, perform code reviews, and integrate changes. Collaboration and transparency are key during this phase. Stabilization and Feature Freeze (2 Weeks): Focus: We enter a feature freeze period where no new features are introduced. Activities: During this time, the focus shifts to thorough testing and stabilization of the new features. This ensures the software’s quality and reliability. Any remaining issues or bugs are addressed to prepare for the release. Cool Down and Planning (2 Weeks): Focus: This phase involves wrapping up the current cycle and preparing for the next one. Activities: Contributors work on upgrading dependencies, resolving minor issues, and documenting the latest changes. Additionally, the team discusses and plans the features and tasks for the next cycle, ensuring a smooth transition. The General Availability (GA) release of SysON occurs on the eighteenth week of each development cycle. Being an open source project, SysON thrives on community participation and collaboration. Here’s how the team is organized: * Core Developers: these are the primary maintainers who oversee the project’s direction, manage releases, and ensure code quality. * Contributors: this includes anyone from the community who contributes code, documentation, or ideas. Contributions are reviewed and merged by core developers. * Community: a diverse group of users, testers, and enthusiasts who provide feedback, report bugs, and propose new features. This collaborative approach allows SysON to continuously evolve while maintaining a high standard of quality and performance. If you’re interested in contributing or have any questions, feel free to join the community discussions or contact us. SysON adheres to a CalVer (Calendar Versioning) strategy to communicate the timeline and stability of its releases. The versioning follows a YEAR.MONTH.PATCH format, where: YEAR.MONTH.0: These are the stable releases, marking significant milestones or major updates. For example, a version like 2024.5.0 indicates a stable release from May 2024. Intermediate Releases: Between the .0 versions, there may be multiple intermediate releases, denoted by increasing the PATCH number (for example 2024.5.1, 2024.5.2). These are intended to provide updates, fixes, and incremental improvements leading up to the next stable release. Stable versions (.0 versions) are recommended for production environments, while intermediate versions offer early access to new features and fixes but might undergo further changes before the next stable release. This strategy ensures that users can rely on a predictable and transparent update cycle, aligning with the continuous evolution and enhancement of SysON.

Detailed explanations walk you through each step. Stable versions Only YEAR.MONTH.0 versions are stable and suitable for production deployments. Other versions, such as intermediate releases, are intended solely for testing purposes. They’re not recommended for production use due to their potential for further changes and instability. Always use the stable .0 releases for any production environments to ensure reliability and support. For more details see SysON development cycle. The easiest and most straightforward method to install SysON using Docker Compose, which automatically installs Java and PostgreSQL. Before you proceed with the installation, please ensure you have the following prerequisites: Docker installed. SysON is distributed as a docker container. To install SysON, just download the docker-compose file and run the following docker command in the same folder as the one where is the docker-compose.yml file: docker compose up This method installs SysON (matching the version tagged in this documentation) along with a PostgreSQL database, all within a Docker container. To install a specific version vYYYY.MM.0, edit the docker-compose.yml file and replace the tagged version with your desired version. For example, update the following line in the docker-compose.yml: app: image: \"${IMAGE_TAG:-eclipsesyson/syson:*vYYYY.MM.0*}\" All accessible versions of SysON as Docker containers are listed in the SysON Docker registry. Once your Docker up, please go directly to the Open your web browser section! Detailed instructions for manually setting up SysON, including PostgreSQL installation with Docker, downloading the JAR application, and starting it manually. Before you proceed with the installation, please ensure you have the following prerequisites: Java supported version Docker installed, or an existing supported database installation with a user that has administrator privileges. SysON is distributed as a single executable Java Archive JAR which contains the complete SysON application along with all its dependencies. This distribution simplifies the setup process, enabling convenient exploration of SysON’s features. To download the latest pre-built JAR for SysON, follow these steps: Before you begin the installation process, navigate to the download page for org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar to access all versions. Identify the SysON latest available version for download. Click the latest version to open its specific page. In the Assets section, locate the JAR file named org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar. Click the JAR file to start the download to your local machine. This process ensures that you get the most recent version of the SysON application in the form of a pre-built JAR file. SysON uses PostgreSQL as its database. For development or local testing, the simplest approach is to initiate a PostgreSQL instance using Docker. docker run -p 5433:5432 --name syson-postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd \\ -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db \\ -d postgres For Windows users, here is the same command on one line: docker run -p 5433:5432 --name syson-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db -d postgres This may take a while the first time you run this as Docker will first pull the PostgreSQL image. If you don’t have Docker or prefer to use an existing PostgreSQL installation, modify the following command-line parameters and ensure the POSTGRES_USER possesses administrative rights on the database. These rights are necessary for the automatic creation of the database schema. To run the application, you’ll need to use the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to execute the pre-build JAR (org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar) you downloaded earlier. Go to the folder containing the org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar and run the command:\" java -jar path\\to\\your\\syson-application-YEAR.MONTH.0.jar \\ --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/syson-db \\ --spring.datasource.username=dbuser \\ --spring.datasource.password=dbpwd Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to experience SysON. To end your local testing session, ensure you stop the running PostgreSQL Docker container using the command docker kill syson-postgres. Please note that this will erase all the data you have generated during testing. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the troubleshooting guide for detailed solutions.

The General view is employed to display any members of exposed model elements. it’s the most general view, enabling presentation of any model element. This view in SysON is implemented as an unsynchronized diagram. This means that users need to manually add existing elements to the diagram to visualize them. It doesn’t display all the information stored in the model by default. User can create General view diagram on any element provided it inherits from Namespace type. The Diagram panel has global actions grouped in a horizontal toolbar underneath the diagram tabs. This toolbar has the following actions: Display full screen, Fit selection to screen, Zoom group: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Share the diagram link, Export diagram as SVG, Toggle snap to grid, Show helper line to align elements, Arrange all elements, Reveal hidden elements, Reveal faded elements, Unpin all elements. Six categories of elements can be represented on General view diagram. The following Definition elements can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Definition, Allocation Definition, Attribute Definition, Constraint Definition, Enumeration Definition, Interface Definition, Item Definition, Metadata Definition, Occurrence Definition, Part Definition, Port Definition, Requirement Definition, UseCase Definition. Definition elements are represented by rectangular node style. Keyword with \"Def\" specification is defined in the label of the node. The following Usage elements can be displayed in the General view diagram: Accept Action usage, Action Usage, Allocation Usage, Attribute Usage, Constraint Usage, Interface Usage, Item Usage, Occurrence Usage, Part Usage, Port Usage, Requirement Usage, UseCase Usage. Usage elements are represented by rectangular node style with rounded corner. The following element in Definition compartments can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Definition can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action, Attribute in Attribute Definition/Interface Definition/Item Definition/Metadata Definition/Occurrence Definition/Part Definition/Port Definition/Requirement Definition, Constraint in Constraint Definition, Enumerated Value in Enumeration Definition, Interface in Interface Definition, Port in Interface Definition/Part Definition, Reference in Metadata Definition/Port Definition, Occurence in Occurrence Definition, Assumed Constraint in Requirement Definition, Required Constraint in Requirement Definition. Each element in Definition nodes are represented in dedicated compartment. A Definition node can have several compartments if Definition element can contain many kind of element. Each compartment is distinguished by a specific identifier. The following element in Usage compartments can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Usage can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action, Item in Action Usage, Allocation in Allocation Usage, Attribute in Attribute Usage/Interface Usage/Item Usage/Part Usage/Port Usage/Requirement Usage, Reference in Attribute Usage/Item Usage/Port Usage, Constraint in Constraint Usage, Port in Interface Usage/Part Usage, Occurrence in Occurrence Usage, Assumed Constraint in Requirement Usage, Required constraint in Requirement Usage. Each element in Definition nodes are represented in dedicated compartment. A Definition node can have several compartments if Definition element can contain many kind of element. Each compartment is distinguished by a specific identifier. Package element can be represented on General view diagram. Its represented by a folder and its label has the keyword package. The following Relationship can be displayed in the General view diagram: Dependency, Subclassification, Redefinition, Subsetting, Feature Typing, Allocation, Containment relation, Succession. User can create element from the background of the diagram from a simple click that displays toolbar. In this toolbar, element creation tool are grouped by type in tool section according to their type. User can expand the tool section and then user can click on the desired creation tool User can also create element in other element. User just clicks on the element to display the toolbar and then click on the desired creation tool. All created element are collapsed by default, it means that if a node with compartment is created, compartment are hidden. If node contains compartment, user can add element in the desired compartment by clicking in the compartment and display the toolbar. An other way is to click on the parent node header of the compartment. A toolbar will be display and the user can click on the desired creation tool, new element will be created in the appropriate compartment. User can only delete a graphical element from the diagram without removing it from the model. User should just click on Delete from diagram button in the palette. User can also remove element from model (and so from diagram) by clicking on Delete from model button in the palette. A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the Delete from model tool in the palette or via the Model Explorer. This behavior can be disabled by checking the \"Disable this confirmation dialog\" checkbox in the dialog. This preference is stored in the local storage of the browser. You can reset it by deleting the SysON data in cache of your browser. Relationship Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge’s source and target types. If no edge creation is authorized with a given target, the target node appears faded. When user try to create an edge, user clicks first on the source element to display arrow border. Then user clicks on one of these arrows and stay click until the target. User can see the feedback of the edge and the target node is highlighted. After releasing the click, a pop-up appears and displays all possible kind of edge to create. If only one kind of edge is possible, the edge is directly create without opening the pop-up. it’s not possible for now to create an Edge between two Edges or between an Edge and a Node. Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element. If the new source or the new target isn’t allowed for reconnection, these one will be faded. To delete relationship from model, user should click on the edge and click on the delete button. Remember that relationship edge are always synchronized, it’s not possible to only delete relationship edge from diagram. Containment relationShip isn’t deletable from the diagram. Other relationship can be deletable from the diagram. Keywords on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label. For example Definition nodes will be prefixed with \"part def\" and Usage node with \"part\". After the keyword, the label can be the simple name of the element, or more complex in some specific cases. Indeed, For example, subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax is supported to describe some element. For simple Definition element, the label will display the keyword \"part def\" and its declared name. For elements using specialization, the label will display the kind of the specilalization. For example, if a Batmobile is a subclassification of Vehicle, its label will display the key word \"part def\" and then \"Batmobile :> Vehicle\" to show its specalization toward Vehicle. If Usage element is given by relationship with multiplicity, the multiplicity value (upper and lower bound) is specified between bracket in the label, just before the specialization. For example, for a Batmobile which contained 4 Wheel by using the Usage wheels then the label will be composed of the keyword \"part\" followed by the name wheels[4] : Wheel which described the Usage wheels with multiplicity 4 defined by the Definition Wheel. For element with compartment node (with list layout), the label of compartment node will be displayed in italic and it will only contained a simple name. No label is defined on edges except in two cases : allocation edge label is specified with its keyword allocate, edge which represent relationship with multiplicity have their multiplicity defined in their label (ex.: containment edge). Element labels can be edited in the following ways: Edit action of the Palette, Press F2, Type directly the new name. With direct edit, user can’t change the keyword but user can change the name. If it’s a simple label, he can rename the element. If user modify the multiplicity defined in the label then the multiplicity of the relationship is changed in the model. User can alos set/change the specialization of a given element. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for direct edit action Label of edges and compartments node can’t be edited. Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram. This drag and drop doesn’t perform any semantic modification. Diagrams also allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram. Note that it’s not possible to Drag and drop an element represented as an Edge on the diagram. User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node. Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded. When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted. From the diagram background or from a given node, it’s possible to display all existing elements contained by the initial selection. User just need to display the palette and unfold Existing elements section. User can click on Add existing elements to display elements directly contained by the selection. User can also click on Add existing elements (recursive) to display elements directly contained by the selection and elements contained by these elements and so on. When user select multiple elements, many actions are available to manage all selected element. After user selected some elements, a simplified toolbar is displayed. User can still used basic tools such as : Hide elements, Fade elements, Pin elements. A new tool section appears in this toolbar. Many tools acting on selected elements layout can be found in this tool section : Align left, Align center, Align right, Align top, Align middle, Align bottom, Arrange in row, Arrange in column, Arrange in grid, Distribute horizontal spacing, Distribute vertical spacing, Justify horizontally, Justify vertically, Make same size. In addition to toolbar actions, some actions can be execute with shortcuts. Indeed, after user selected some elements, user can press the key \"Del\" to remove all selected elements. User can also move all selected element on the diagram without changing its graphical or semantic parent.","title":"General view","component":"syson","version":"v2024.9.0","name":"general-view","url":"/syson/v2024.9.0/user-manual/features/general-view.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The Interconnection view is used to show encapsulated structural contents of _Usage- element: Parts, Properties, Connectors, Ports, and Interfaces. This view in SysON is implemented as an unsynchronized diagram. This means that users need to manually add existing elements to the diagram to visualize them. It doesn’t display all the information stored in the model by default. User can create Interconnection view on any Usage or Definition element. The Diagram panel has global actions grouped in a horizontal toolbar underneath the diagram tabs. This toolbar has the following actions: Display full screen, Fit selection to screen, Zoom group: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Share the diagram link, Export diagram as SVG, Toggle snap to grid, Show helper line to align elements, Arrange all elements, Reveal hidden elements, Reveal faded elements, Unpin all elements. From the root Usage, two elements can be displayed in the Interconnection view diagram: Usage part, port. From compartment of Usage part, three elements can be displayed in the Interconnection view diagram: attribute part port The following Relationship can be displayed in the General view diagram: Binding connector as Usage, Allocation, User can create element from the background of the diagram from a simple click that displays toolbar. In this toolbar, element creation tool are grouped by type in tool section according to their type. User can expand the tool section and then user can click on the desired creation tool User can also create element in other element. User just clicks on the element to display the toolbar and then click on the desired creation tool. All created element are collapsed by default, it means that if a node with compartment is created, compartment are hidden. If node contains compartment, user can add element in the desired compartment by clicking in the compartment and display the toolbar. An other way is to click on the parent node header of the compartment. A toolbar will be display and the user can click on the desired creation tool, new element will be created in the appropriate compartment. User can only delete a graphical element from the diagram without removing it from the model. User should just click on Delete from diagram button in the palette. User can also remove element from model (and so from diagram) by clicking on Delete from model button in the palette. A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the Delete from model tool in the palette or via the Model Explorer. This behavior can be disabled by checking the \"Disable this confirmation dialog\" checkbox in the dialog. This preference is stored in the local storage of the browser. You can reset it by deleting the SysON data in cache of your browser. Relationship Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge’s source and target types. If no edge creation is authorized with a given target, the target node appears faded. When user try to create an edge, user clicks first on the source element to display arrow border. Then user clicks on one of these arrows and stay click until the target. User can see the feedback of the edge and the target node is highlighted. After releasing the click, a pop-up appears and displays all possible kind of edge to create. If only one kind of edge is possible, the edge is directly create without opening the pop-up. it’s not possible for now to create an Edge between two Edges or between an Edge and a Node. Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element. If the new source or the new target isn’t allowed for reconnection, these one will be faded. To delete relationship from model, user should click on the edge and click on the delete button. Remember that relationship edge are always synchronized, it’s not possible to only delete relationship edge from diagram. Containment relationShip isn’t deletable from the diagram. Other relationship can be deletable from the diagram. Keywords on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label. For example Definition nodes will be prefixed with \"part def\" and Usage node with \"part\". After the keyword, the label can be the simple name of the element, or more complex in some specific cases. Indeed, For example, subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax is supported to describe some element. For simple Definition element, the label will display the keyword \"part def\" and its declared name. For elements using specialization, the label will display the kind of the specilalization. For example, if a Batmobile is a subclassification of Vehicle, its label will display the key word \"part def\" and then \"Batmobile :> Vehicle\" to show its specalization toward Vehicle. If Usage element is given by relationship with multiplicity, the multiplicity value (upper and lower bound) is specified between bracket in the label, just before the specialization. For example, for a Batmobile which contained 4 Wheel by using the Usage wheels then the label will be composed of the keyword \"part\" followed by the name wheels[4] : Wheel which described the Usage wheels with multiplicity 4 defined by the Definition Wheel. For element with compartment node (with list layout), the label of compartment node will be displayed in italic and it will only contained a simple name. No label is defined on edges except in two cases : allocation edge label is specified with its keyword allocate, edge which represent relationship with multiplicity have their multiplicity defined in their label (ex.: containment edge). Element labels can be edited in the following ways: Edit action of the Palette, Press F2, Type directly the new name. With direct edit, user can’t change the keyword but user can change the name. If it’s a simple label, he can rename the element. If user modify the multiplicity defined in the label then the multiplicity of the relationship is changed in the model. User can alos set/change the specialization of a given element. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for direct edit action Label of edges and compartments node can’t be edited. Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram. This drag and drop doesn’t perform any semantic modification. Diagrams also allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram. Note that it’s not possible to Drag and drop an element represented as an Edge on the diagram. User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node. Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded. When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted. From the diagram background or from a given node, it’s possible to display all existing elements contained by the initial selection. User just need to display the palette and unfold Existing elements section. User can click on Add existing elements to display elements directly contained by the selection. User can also click on Add existing elements (recursive) to display elements directly contained by the selection and elements contained by these elements and so on. When user select multiple elements, many actions are available to manage all selected element. After user selected some elements, a simplified toolbar is displayed. User can still used basic tools such as : Hide elements, Fade elements, Pin elements. A new tool section appears in this toolbar. Many tools acting on selected elements layout can be found in this tool section : Align left, Align center, Align right, Align top, Align middle, Align bottom, Arrange in row, Arrange in column, Arrange in grid, Distribute horizontal spacing, Distribute vertical spacing, Justify horizontally, Justify vertically, Make same size. In addition to toolbar actions, some actions can be execute with shortcuts. Indeed, after user selected some elements, user can press the key \"Del\" to remove all selected elements. User can also move all selected element on the diagram without changing its graphical or semantic parent.","title":"Interconnection view","component":"syson","version":"v2024.9.0","name":"interconnection-view","url":"/syson/v2024.9.0/user-manual/features/interconnection-view.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

However, understanding the scaling limits of the system is essential for planning and optimizing your usage to ensure performance and efficiency. Below, we outline the primary scaling factors and limitations related to model size, semantic elements, representations, project management, and user concurrency. Maximum Model Size: SysON is built to manage large models, but there are practical limits to its capacity. The system can efficiently handle models up to about 10 MB in size. Models larger than this might experience performance degradation, especially in terms of loading times and responsiveness. Impact on Performance: As model size increases, users might meet longer loading times and slower response rates when performing operations such as editing or navigating the model. It’s recommended to break down exceptionally large models into smaller, manageable sub-models where feasible. Element Capacity: SysON can manage models containing up to 150,000 semantic elements. These elements include elements, relationships, and attributes that define the structure and behavior of the model. Performance Considerations: Exceeding this number might lead to increased memory usage and slower query responses. For optimal performance, it’s advisable to maintain a balance and avoid overly complex models that push the upper limit of this capacity. Representation Limits: The system supports up to 2,000 distinct representations per project. Complexity and Usability: While the system can handle a high number of representations, maintaining a clear and organized structure is crucial. Overloading a project with too many representations can complicate navigation and reduce usability. Element Density: A single representation can display up to 1,000 elements. Beyond this, the representation might become cluttered, making it difficult to interpret and work with the visual data. Performance and Visualization: High-density representations may slow down rendering times and interaction speed. It’s beneficial to segment large visualizations into smaller, more focused views to maintain clarity and performance. Project Management: SysON can support up to 1,000 concurrent projects per server. This allows organizations to manage multiple initiatives simultaneously without significant performance degradation. Server Load: The number of projects impacts server load and resource allocation. While the system can support a high number of projects, each project adds to the computational and storage demands, so server capacity should be scaled so. User Capacity: The system is designed to support up to 80 concurrent users on a single server. This capacity ensures that people can collaborate in real-time without encountering significant slowdowns or access issues. Collaboration Dynamics: The performance of collaborative features, such as live editing and real-time updates, might vary depending on the number of users and the complexity of the operations being performed. For larger teams, it’s important to monitor server load and possibly segment users across multiple servers if necessary. Model Partitioning: To manage large models, consider breaking them down into smaller, modular sub-models. This can help maintain performance and make it easier to manage and navigate complex data. Efficient Representations: Limit the number of elements displayed in each representation to avoid clutter and maintain responsiveness. Use multiple, focused representations instead of one overloaded view. Scalable Infrastructure: Ensure that your server infrastructure is scalable to handle increases in project load and user concurrency. This might involve using cloud-based solutions that can dynamically allocate resources as needed. Regular Monitoring: Implement regular monitoring of system performance and user activity to identify and address potential bottlenecks. This can help maintain smooth operation even as the scale of use increases. Contact us for custom solutions: If your needs exceed the outlined limits or you require specific performance optimizations, please contact us. Our team can provide tailored solutions and advice to ensure that SysON meets your scaling requirements effectively.

In the context of Model-Based Systems Engineering - MBSE, where diverse teams contribute to different facets of a project, having an open source tool becomes a unifying force. It allows seamless collaboration and information exchange among stakeholders, regardless of their preferred tools or methodologies. SysON empowers users to seamlessly transition between graphical and textual representations, accommodating diverse modeling preferences and the specific demands of the systems under analysis. This flexibility is crucial in MBSE, where the ability to articulate and refine models in different modalities is instrumental in capturing the complexity inherent in modern system designs. The extensibility of SysML v2 within SysON is a key aspect that reinforces its adaptability to diverse industries and complex project landscapes. In MBSE, where each domain might have unique requirements and specifications, having a tool that can be tailored to meet these specific needs is invaluable. SysON’s extensibility ensures that it remains a dynamic and adaptable resource for system engineers working across various domains. As SysON evolves, guided by the principles of SysML v2, it positions itself as more than just a tool; it evolves into a comprehensive and standardized environment for MBSE endeavors. The commitment to open source and interoperability serves as a cornerstone for future developments, ensuring that SysON continues to meet the evolving needs of the MBSE community. In essence, SysON stands as an open source enabler, promoting collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability—fundamental principles in the ever-evolving landscape of MBSE. SysON extends its utility by introducing the capability to import and export projects in JSON format. This feature enhances interoperability, allowing users to seamlessly exchange project data and collaborate with external tools or platforms. SysON doesn’t support the SysML v2 Standard JSON format for import/export. For detailed instructions on downloading projects, downloading models, uploading projects, and uploading models, please refer to the respective sections in the documentation. These sections provide step-by-step guidance on how to perform these actions within the SysON environment. SysON support SysML v2 textual specifications as an exchange format in order facilitate smooth transitions between tools. This intent reflects SysON’s dedication to staying aligned with evolving industry standards. Add-on has been developed to enable import/export capability to and from SysML v2 textual syntax. This feature provides users with additional flexibility in their modeling workflows. Before importing a file, you need to make sure that all the dependences of this file are also imported, and this, recursively. Otherwise some relationship won’t be resolved. For example if you want to import a file that uses third party libraries, you will need to import the third party libraries before the actual file, otherwise you might have unreferenced relations. Most important SysML v2 concepts can be translated from the imported file, some concept are still under development to enable complete import/export capability from and to SysML v2 textual syntax. Stay tuned for updates on its availability in the project.

The changes are: AnnotatingElement add derived reference \"ownedAnnotatingRelationship : Annotation\" Annotation add derived reference \"owningAnnotatingElement : AnnotatingElement\" Connector remove attribute \"isDirected : boolean\" OperatorExpression remove derived reference \"operand : Expression\" ParameterMembership add operation \"parameterDirection() : FeatureDirectionKind\" Type add operation \"directionOfExcluding(Feature, Type[0..\\*]) : FeatureDirectionKind\" Refactor and simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram, the following classes have been deleted, renamed, or merged: Deleted InterconnectionViewForDefinitionDescriptionProvider Deleted InterconnectionViewForDefinitionDiagramDescriptionProvider Deleted InterconnectionViewForUsageDiagramDescriptionProvider Merged RootUsageNodeDescriptionProvider and RootDefinitionNodeDescriptionProvider into RootNodeDescriptionProvider Renamed FirstLevelChildPartUsageNodeDescriptionProvider to FirstLevelChildUsageNodeDescriptionProvider Renamed ChildPartUsageNodeDescriptionProvider to ChildUsageNodeDescriptionProvider Switch to Sirius Web 2024.7.1: all diagrams must be deleted and created again, due to the fix of this Sirius Web bug. Add tool to create an ExhibitState from a StateUsage, the following classes & methods have been deleted or modified to simplify the handling of ExhibitStates Deleted StateTransitionToggleExhibitStateToolProvider Deleted UtilService#canBeExhibitedStateUsage Deleted UtilService#setUnsetAsExhibit Deleted UtilService#isExhibitedStateUsage Deleted UtilService#getAllReachableStatesWithoutReferencialExhibitExpression Deleted ViewNodeService#isHiddenByDefaultExhibitStates Deleted ViewNodeService#isHiddenByDefaultNonExhibitStates Add new IViewDiagramElementFinder parameter to StateTransitionViewNodeToolSectionSwitch Migrate frontend to MUI 5, if you contributed React components that use MUI, you should upgrade them to use MUI 5. Ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed, the following methods have been moved to support this feature The method ToolService#dropElementFromExplorer has been moved to ViewToolService since it now requires view-related imports that motivated this refactoring. The method ToolService#dropElementFromDiagram has been moved to ViewToolService for the sake of consistency. Fix Add Existing Elements tool for start and done actions, the following methods have been moved to UtilService to make them reusable by different services (they are now used by ViewNodeService and ViewToolService): ViewNodeService#getAllStandardStartActions ViewNodeService#getAllStandardDoneActions ViewNodeService#isAction ViewNodeService#isPart Split DiagramDirectEditListener#exitExpression directEdit service into two services : exitNodeExpression and exitListItemExpression to specify the grahical context of use . Add new boolean parameter isCompartmentItem to the LabelService#directEdit service to clarify the graphical element type to edit. Rename LabelService#getUsagePrefix into getUsageListItemPrefix to specify the computation of this prefix on list item elements. Rename ViewLabelService#getInitialDirectEditLabel service into getInitialDirectEditListItemLabel to specify the computation of the initial label on list item elements. Fix an issue that revealed the documentation compartment when dropping an element on itself, the following method’s contract has been updated as part of the fix: EMFUtils#isAncestor(parent, eObject) now returns true if parent == eObject. Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package, the tool Create Package is not available in Action Flow View diagrams anymore. Switch to Sirius Web 2024.9.0 Migrate frontend to MUI 5 Switch to maven-checkstyle-plugin 3.4.0 Switch to Spring Boot 3.3.1 Add a dependency to CycloneDX to compute the backend software bill of materials during the build Add a dependency to pathfinding Prevent nested part to be rendered as border nodes in the Interconnection View diagram. Fix an issue where a click on inherited members inside compartments was raising an error instead of displaying the palette. Fix an issue where non-containment references in standard libraries weren’t correctly imported into the project’s editing context. Remove owning Usage memberships from inherited memberships of Usages. Memberships of a Type are inherited via Specialization or Conjugation, not by composition. Fix an issue that allowed to drop an element from the explorer or the diagram on one of its children. Doing so deleted both the dropped element and its children from the diagram, and could delete the representation if one of the element was the root element of the representation. Fix an issue that made the direct edit not working on Constraint and Requirement elements. Fix an issue that made the addExistingElements not work properly for start and done actions inside actions and parts. Fix an issue on constraint expression name resolution that prevented from referencing elements in other containing namespaces than the direct owner of the constraint. It is now possible to reference an element in any of the containing namespaces of the constraint. Fix an issue that deleted the content of an action when it was dropped from the diagram to an action flow compartment. Fix an issue where it was impossible anymore to set the cardinality of an Element as graphical node through direct edit. Fix an issue where ConjugatedPortDefinition labels were rendered as null instead of their actual name. Fix an issue that made direct edit of names not working on nodes in the Interconnection View diagram. Fix an issue that revealed the documentation compartment when dropping an element on itself. The drop isn’t allowed anymore, and a warning message is displayed. Fix an issue that deleted feature typing specialization when nesting a PartUsage in a PartDefinition. The tool Add Part as nested Part now correctly keeps the existing relationships of the PartUsage after its owner is changed. Fix an issue that prevented the drop of the root element of a diagram on its background. Fix an issue that made all the elements references when imported by the SysMLParser. Add actions in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add states in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add ExhibitStates on General View diagram Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a PartUsage/PartDefinition Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a StateUsage/StateDefinition The InterfaceUsage created by the New Interface edge tool in the Interconnection View diagram are now created under closest containing Definition/Package. Simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram and remove duplicated code Add action node in Interconnection View diagram Add documentation and action flow compartments for action nodes in the Interconnection View diagram Add label support for referential Usages Nodes that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword Elements in lists that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword AttributeUsage do not contain the \"ref\" keyword since they are always referential Add support for \"ref\" keyword in direct edit Prefixing the name of an Usage with \"ref\" sets it as a reference Not setting the \"ref\" prefix of an Usage sets it as a composite (non-reference) Use empty diamond source style for nested reference usage edge Nested usages that are composite are connected by a filled diamond edge Nested usages that are references are connected by an empty diamond edge Modify the creation of an ExhibitState from a StateUsage or StateDefinition. There is now several tools for creating an ExhibitState. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. Display qualified names in diagrams nodes' labels in case of standard libraries elements. Allow to select existing Action on Perform tool. Allow to set measurement units via direct edit. It is now possible to configure the measurement unit for the value of an element, e.g. mass = 10 [kg]. Allow to select existing Type on Subject tool. Display prefix keywords in label for Usage compartment element Display multiplicity suffix property keywords in label for Usage element Allow direct edit of prefix keywords and multiplicity suffix for Usage elements Prefixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with direction or \"abstract\" or \"variation\" or \"readonly\" or \"derived\" or \"end\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Suffixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with \"ordered\" or \"nonunique\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Add support for constraint expressions in the general view. Constraints with expressions such as mass >= 10 [kg] are now correctly parsed and the corresponding semantic objects are created in the constraint. Add actors compartment in UseCase and Requirement in the General View diagram. Handle the representation of actors on the General View diagram. Actors are represented with a stick figure image, with their label displayed below the image. Add support for edges between actors and their containing UseCase/Requirement in the General View diagram. The source of the edge (the UseCase or Requirement) can be reconnected to another UseCase or Requirement, but the target (Actor) cannot be reconnected. Allow to select existing RequirementUsage and RequirementDefinition on Objective tool. Add a check to make the build fail if a Cypress test contains it.only. Add support for public import in direct edit specializations. It is now possible to specialize an element with a qualified name containing namespaces importing the required features. For example, myAttribute : ISQ::MassValue now correctly types the attribute with ISQBase::MassValue. Improve the support of root Namespaces in SysON documents. Root Namespaces are now implicitly created at the root of SysON documents. Creating an element at the root of a SysON document now creates it in its root Namespace. A new filter is available to hide root Namespaces and is enabled by default. It is no longer possible to create Namespace from the explorer. It is no longer possible to create a representation on a root Namespace. Improve the drop from the explorer to ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed. Display prefix keywords in labels of Definitions and Usages graphical nodes. Ensure that dropping an element from the explorer on the diagram reveals the corresponding node if it is already on the diagram and hidden. A warning message is now displayed when attempting to drop an element which is already displayed and visible in the target container. Ignore keywords order during direct edit of prefixes labels of Definitions and Usages graphical elements. DirectEdit on graphical node or list item authorized only to modify keywords which can be displayed in each label. Allow to drop a Definition from the explorer on an Usage on a diagram or in a list compartment to type it. Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package. Add \"Show/Hide Icons in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide icons in the diagrams (icons are not part of the SysMLv2 specification). Add new tools allowing to create an ExhibitState at the root of General View and StateTransition View. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. The selected State will be added to the diagram, not the new ExhibitState. Handle FlowConnectionUsage between PortUsages in Interconnection View. A new edge tool allows to create a flow between two ports. Add tools to set a Feature as composite or reference. Handle ItemUsage in Interconnection View and FlowConnectionUsage using items as their source/target. Add documentation property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a documentation for the selected element. This property widget will only handle the first documentation associated to the selected element. If no documentation is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a Documentation element and will associate it to the selected element. Add new \"New objects from text\" menu entry on elements in Explorer view, allowing to insert textual SysMLv2 as objects under the selected element. The menu entry shows a dialog with a textarea allowing to write or paste textual SysMLv2. A click on the Insert button converts the textual SysMLv2 into model elements and add them under the selected element. Improve the drag and drop of container elements to move their content. Handle implicit specializations from standard libraries for Usages/Definitions. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from users models in diagrams. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members from Standard Libraries in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from standard libraries in diagrams.","title":"2024.9.0","component":"syson","version":"v2024.9.0","name":"2024.9.0","url":"/syson/v2024.9.0/user-manual/release-notes/2024.9.0.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Fix an issue where the Adjust size tool had no effect on Packages nodes. Fix an issue where the double quotes were set along with the string value in case of a direct edit of the value part. Allow the creation of sub-Packages in the model explorer Add root Namespace to SysON models and libraries to conform to SysMLv2 specification. Improve support for whitespace, quotes, and special characters in direct edit. Handle start and done actions in Action Flow View & General View diagrams. Add State and StateDefinition in the General View diagram. Add Transition source and target to Core properties in the Details view. All redefines references of the SysMLv2 metamodel have been implemented. The textual import running process have been improved. By default, end users don’t have to copy syside-cli.js near the syson-application jar anymore. The embedded syside-cli.js is copied in a system temp folder and executed from there (with node). But, if you encounter execution rights problem, you can still copy syside-cli.js in a place where you have the appropriate rights and use the org.eclipse.syson.syside.path application option. Property \"Typed by\" is now always visible in the Details view for Feature elements, even if the Feature doesn’t have a type yet. Rename creation tools for Start and Done actions (from Add Start/Done to New Start/Done) Reduce the default height of the Package node in diagrams Move Feature#direction in Core properties tab of the Details view Sort New Object menu entries Add Direct Edit tool in Control (ForkNode, JoinNode…​) nodes palettes Allow multiple occurrences of Start and Done actions in actions compartments. Rewrite textual import. It is still an experimental feature but should now be faster and accurate. Rewrite the addExistingElement tool. The tool now works correctly on packages, and doesn’t render sibling elements when their semantic element has been rendered by another node (e.g. in a compartment). The empty/null values for Subsetting/Redefinition/Subclassification/FeatureTyping are not displayed anymore in diagram node labels. Add tools for creating Ports with direction Add tools for creation Items with direction Change the default name of the transition element to source_to_target Provide new icons for State, Conjugation, Port (in,in/out,out) and Item (in,in/out,out). Add tools to create Items and Parts in Port and PortDefinition Add tool to create Requirements in RequirementDefinition Add tools for creating Items on ActionDefinition in GeneralView and ActionFlowView. AcceptAction is now available inside an Action body Add private and protected visibility decorators on all elements Add Cypress test infrastructure and execute the Cypress tests as part of pull request checks. Add integration test infrastructure Initial contribution of this documentation Handle the JoinNode, MergeNode, ForkNode, DecisionNode elements in actions compartments. Handle the ExhibitState elements in diagrams Add new documentation compartment on all existing nodes in all diagrams. Expanded Diagram and Model Support: We’ve significantly expanded our support for various views, including the addition of representations for use cases, occurrences, and allocations. This enhancement provides more comprehensive tools to visualize and manage SysML v2 models. This includes the addition of diagrams for use cases, occurrences, and allocations. Improved User Experience: We’ve improved how elements are displayed, particularly in terms of ports and compartments. These enhancements ensure a clearer and more intuitive user interface. Increased Stability and Reliability: We’ve addressed several key bugs and stability issues including fixing problems with diagrams and import capabilities. These improvements help maintain the integrity and accuracy of semantic data. First Export Capability: Our enhanced integration of SysIDE now supports better integration of the SysML v2 format. We’re now able to export projects in the standard textual format, facilitating easier data sharing and compatibility with other industry-standard tools. This promotes better data exchange and collaboration. The requirement-view diagram has been introduced by error in the last release. This diagram isn’t defined in the SysMLv2 specification. It has been deleted in this release. Switch to Sirius Web v2024.5.0 Switch to @ObeoNetwork/gantt-task-react 0.4.9 Add dependency to org.apache.commons.commons-text 1.10.0 The \"Add existing elements (recursive)\" has been modified to work on PartUsage. From Interconnection view diagram, attributes compartment has been added in children PartUsage nodes.

It’s possible to turn-off and turn-on the synchronization between the Project Explorer and the current selection in the Project Editor. When synchronization is enabled, if you selects an element inside a representation, the Project Explorer view will ensure that the corresponding semantic element is visible and selected. This can require expanding new tree items which were previously not visible or scrolling the Project Explorer’s view. When moving between elements in a representation, this can quickly result in an Project Explorer view with many tree items expanded, which can be confusing. The Synchronize toggle button in the Project Explorer can be used to disable this synchronization. When synchronization is disabled, tree items that are already expanded in the Project Explorer are still selected, but no new tree items are automatically expanded.

This capability allows for precise filtering and highlighting of elements based on specified criteria. The filter bar can only highlight items in the expanded state; it doesn’t search within unexpanded children. Ensure the desired tree items are expanded to effectively use the filter and highlight capability. Three filters are available in the Project Explorer to filter element by kind: Hide Memberships, Hide KerML Standard Libraries, Hide SysML Standard Libraries. These filters allow to clear the Project Explorer view.

The SysON supports a subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax, which allows you to update several elements simultaneously. This makes it more efficient to edit models. In general, you can edit the label of a shape in a diagram, and the diagram editor tries to interpret your input and update the corresponding element properties. If an element has a complex name such as someElementName[x]:someTypeName:>someElement, when editing, you must retain all the written parts; otherwise, you risk unsetting some values. Here are some shortcuts for efficiently editing SysON models: Typing someName updates the name of the selected element. Typing :SomeTypeName, sets the type of the selected element to SomeTypeName. If SomeTypeName doesn’t exist, it’s created as an appropriate type element (for example Item Definition, Part Definition, …​) within the same parent container as the selected element. Typing [x] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to x. Typing [1..x] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to 1..x. Typing [x..*] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to x..*. Typing someElement:>otherElement on a element sets someElement as a subsetting of the otherElement if both element are of the same type. Otherwise, it creates a specialization relationship between someElement and otherElement. Typing someElement:>>otherElement on an element sets someElement as a redefinition of otherElement. These shortcuts offer a convenient way to update model elements efficiently.","title":"Model management","component":"syson","version":"v2024.9.0","name":"model-management","url":"/syson/v2024.9.0/user-manual/hands-on/how-tos/model-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Due to the high volume of temporary files generated by SysON applications, antivirus software can significantly impact performance by causing excessive disk I/O and resource contention. In some cases, even disabling antivirus software might not be sufficient to resolve performance issues. In such situations, you may need to restart the server or completely uninstall the antivirus software. Here are some specific recommendations for configuring antivirus software for use with SysON server: Exclude SysON Application Folders from Scanning: Identify the installation directory of your SysON application and exclude it from regular antivirus scans. This will minimize the impact of antivirus scanning on SysON performance. Schedule Scanning Times: If possible, schedule antivirus scans during off-peak hours when SysON usage is minimal. This will reduce the likelihood of performance degradation during active usage periods. Configure Real-time Scanning: Adjust real-time scanning settings to minimize the impact on SysON performance. Consider disabling real-time scanning for specific SysON processes or files that are known to cause performance issues. Monitor Resource Utilization: Continuously monitor resource utilization, especially CPU and disk I/O, to identify any potential bottlenecks caused by antivirus software. Adjust scanning settings or consider uninstalling the antivirus software if it significantly impacts SysON performance. Consult with Antivirus Vendor: If you continue to experience performance issues despite optimizing antivirus settings, consider contacting the antivirus vendor for specific guidance on configuring their software for optimal compatibility with SysON applications. Remember, the goal is to achieve a balance between comprehensive antivirus protection and minimizing its impact on SysON performance. By carefully configuring antivirus settings and monitoring resource utilization, you can ensure that your SysON server operates smoothly while maintaining a robust security posture.","title":"Configure Anti-virus software for use with SysON server","component":"syson","version":"main","name":"anti-virus","url":"/syson/main/installation-guide/anti-virus.html","titles":[]},"259":{"id":259,"text":"Before diving into the installation process, it’s crucial to understand the underlying architecture of SysON.

You should aim to offer a network with the lowest possible latency between the client and the server. To get optimal performance, it’s strongly recommend hosting both the server and database on the same physical server to reduce latency between the two components. Virtual Private Network - VPN aren’t recommended. It’s a common latency factor such as other network elements that could drop connections that are more or less inactive. As such wireless connection are also not recommended as any loss of connectivity might lead to instability in the product and loss of data. If a network element of this kind is mandatory, use an SSH tunnel as a workaround to avoid client/server disconnections. SysON should be the unique way to edit the information stored in the database.

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3). 3. REQUIREMENTS 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then: a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3. 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code: a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement. Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice “This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.” Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses. If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice. You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.","title":"Legal Information","component":"syson","version":"main","name":"index","url":"/syson/main/product-legal/index.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The cycle spans 8 weeks and includes three main phases: Development (4 Weeks): Focus: This phase is dedicated to actively working on new features, bug fixes, and enhancements. Activities: Contributors, including community members and core developers, work together to develop new functionalities, perform code reviews, and integrate changes. Collaboration and transparency are key during this phase. Stabilization and Feature Freeze (2 Weeks): Focus: We enter a feature freeze period where no new features are introduced. Activities: During this time, the focus shifts to thorough testing and stabilization of the new features. This ensures the software’s quality and reliability. Any remaining issues or bugs are addressed to prepare for the release. Cool Down and Planning (2 Weeks): Focus: This phase involves wrapping up the current cycle and preparing for the next one. Activities: Contributors work on upgrading dependencies, resolving minor issues, and documenting the latest changes. Additionally, the team discusses and plans the features and tasks for the next cycle, ensuring a smooth transition. The General Availability (GA) release of SysON occurs on the eighteenth week of each development cycle. Being an open source project, SysON thrives on community participation and collaboration. Here’s how the team is organized: * Core Developers: these are the primary maintainers who oversee the project’s direction, manage releases, and ensure code quality. * Contributors: this includes anyone from the community who contributes code, documentation, or ideas. Contributions are reviewed and merged by core developers. * Community: a diverse group of users, testers, and enthusiasts who provide feedback, report bugs, and propose new features. This collaborative approach allows SysON to continuously evolve while maintaining a high standard of quality and performance. If you’re interested in contributing or have any questions, feel free to join the community discussions or contact us. SysON adheres to a CalVer (Calendar Versioning) strategy to communicate the timeline and stability of its releases. The versioning follows a YEAR.MONTH.PATCH format, where: YEAR.MONTH.0: These are the stable releases, marking significant milestones or major updates. For example, a version like 2024.5.0 indicates a stable release from May 2024. Intermediate Releases: Between the .0 versions, there may be multiple intermediate releases, denoted by increasing the PATCH number (for example 2024.5.1, 2024.5.2). These are intended to provide updates, fixes, and incremental improvements leading up to the next stable release. Stable versions (.0 versions) are recommended for production environments, while intermediate versions offer early access to new features and fixes but might undergo further changes before the next stable release. This strategy ensures that users can rely on a predictable and transparent update cycle, aligning with the continuous evolution and enhancement of SysON.

The General view is employed to display any members of exposed model elements. it’s the most general view, enabling presentation of any model element. This view in SysON is implemented as an unsynchronized diagram. This means that users need to manually add existing elements to the diagram to visualize them. It doesn’t display all the information stored in the model by default. User can create General view diagram on any element provided it inherits from Namespace type. The Diagram panel has global actions grouped in a horizontal toolbar underneath the diagram tabs. This toolbar has the following actions: Display full screen, Fit selection to screen, Zoom group: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Share the diagram link, Export diagram as SVG, Toggle snap to grid, Show helper line to align elements, Arrange all elements, Reveal hidden elements, Reveal faded elements, Unpin all elements. Six categories of elements can be represented on General view diagram. The following Definition elements can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Definition, Allocation Definition, Attribute Definition, Constraint Definition, Enumeration Definition, Interface Definition, Item Definition, Metadata Definition, Occurrence Definition, Part Definition, Port Definition, Requirement Definition, UseCase Definition. Definition elements are represented by rectangular node style. Keyword with \"Def\" specification is defined in the label of the node. The following Usage elements can be displayed in the General view diagram: Accept Action usage, Action Usage, Allocation Usage, Attribute Usage, Constraint Usage, Interface Usage, Item Usage, Occurrence Usage, Part Usage, Port Usage, Requirement Usage, UseCase Usage. Usage elements are represented by rectangular node style with rounded corner. The following element in Definition compartments can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Definition can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action, Attribute in Attribute Definition/Interface Definition/Item Definition/Metadata Definition/Occurrence Definition/Part Definition/Port Definition/Requirement Definition, Constraint in Constraint Definition, Documentation in all Definition elements, Enumerated Value in Enumeration Definition, Interface in Interface Definition, Port in Interface Definition/Part Definition, Reference in Metadata Definition/Port Definition, Occurence in Occurrence Definition, Assumed Constraint in Requirement Definition, Required Constraint in Requirement Definition. Each element in Definition nodes are represented in dedicated compartment. A Definition node can have several compartments if Definition element can contain many kind of element. Each compartment is distinguished by a specific identifier. The following element in Usage compartments can be displayed in the General view diagram: Action Usage can contain in its body Action, Accept action, Start action, Done action, Fork action, Join action, Merge action, Decision action and Perform action, Item in Action Usage, Allocation in Allocation Usage, Attribute in Attribute Usage/Interface Usage/Item Usage/Part Usage/Port Usage/Requirement Usage, Reference in Attribute Usage/Item Usage/Port Usage, Constraint in Constraint Usage, Documentation in all Usage elements, Port in Interface Usage/Part Usage, Occurrence in Occurrence Usage, Assumed Constraint in Requirement Usage, Required constraint in Requirement Usage. Each element in Definition nodes are represented in dedicated compartment. A Definition node can have several compartments if Definition element can contain many kind of element. Each compartment is distinguished by a specific identifier. Package element can be represented on General view diagram. It is represented by a folder and its label has the keyword package. Annotating elements such as Documentation and Comment elements can be represented on General view diagram. It is represented by a note node and its label contains the body of the Annotating element in addition to its declared name. The label of Documentation node also includes the keyword doc whereas the label of Comment node includes the keyword comment. The following Relationship can be displayed in the General view diagram: Dependency, Subclassification, Redefinition, Subsetting, Feature Typing, Allocation, Containment relation, Succession. User can create element from the background of the diagram from a simple click that displays palette. In this palette, element creation tool are grouped by type in tool sections according to their type. User can click on the tool section and then click on the desired creation tool. image::manage-elements-fromBackground-creation.png[Creation from Diagram Background] image::manage-elements-fromBackground-creation-2.png[Creation from Diagram Background] The palette has a search field allowing to search in all tool sections. User can also create element in other element. User just clicks on the element to display the toolbar and then click on the desired creation tool. All created element are collapsed by default, it means that if a node with compartment is created, compartment are hidden. If node contains compartment, user can add element in the desired compartment by clicking in the compartment and display the palette. An other way is to click on the parent node header of the compartment. A palette will be display and the user can click on the desired creation tool (inside tool sections), new element will be created in the appropriate compartment. User can only delete a graphical element from the diagram without removing it from the model. User should just click on Delete from diagram button in the palette. User can also remove element from model (and so from diagram) by clicking on Delete from model button in the palette. A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the Delete from model tool in the palette or via the Model Explorer. This behavior can be disabled by checking the \"Disable this confirmation dialog\" checkbox in the dialog. This preference is stored in the local storage of the browser. You can reset it by deleting the SysON data in cache of your browser. Relationship Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge’s source and target types. If no edge creation is authorized with a given target, the target node appears faded. When user try to create an edge, user clicks first on the source element to display arrow border. Then user clicks on one of these arrows and stay click until the target. User can see the feedback of the edge and the target node is highlighted. After releasing the click, a pop-up appears and displays all possible kind of edge to create. If only one kind of edge is possible, the edge is directly create without opening the pop-up. it’s not possible for now to create an Edge between two Edges or between an Edge and a Node. Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element. If the new source or the new target isn’t allowed for reconnection, these one will be faded. To delete relationship from model, user should click on the edge and click on the delete button. Remember that relationship edge are always synchronized, it’s not possible to only delete relationship edge from diagram. Containment relationShip isn’t deletable from the diagram. Other relationship can be deletable from the diagram. Keywords on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label. For example Definition nodes will be prefixed with \"part def\" and Usage node with \"part\". After the keyword, the label can be the simple name of the element, or more complex in some specific cases. Indeed, For example, subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax is supported to describe some element. For simple Definition element, the label will display the keyword \"part def\" and its declared name. For elements using specialization, the label will display the kind of the specilalization. For example, if a Batmobile is a subclassification of Vehicle, its label will display the key word \"part def\" and then \"Batmobile :> Vehicle\" to show its specalization toward Vehicle. If Usage element is given by relationship with multiplicity, the multiplicity value (upper and lower bound) is specified between bracket in the label, just before the specialization. For example, for a Batmobile which contained 4 Wheel by using the Usage wheels then the label will be composed of the keyword \"part\" followed by the name wheels[4] : Wheel which described the Usage wheels with multiplicity 4 defined by the Definition Wheel. For element with compartment node (with list layout), the label of compartment node will be displayed in italic and it will only contained a simple name. No label is defined on edges except in two cases : allocation edge label is specified with its keyword allocate, edge which represent relationship with multiplicity have their multiplicity defined in their label (ex.: containment edge). Element labels can be edited in the following ways: Edit action of the Palette, Press F2, Type directly the new name. With direct edit, user can’t change the keyword but user can change the name. If it’s a simple label, he can rename the element. If user modify the multiplicity defined in the label then the multiplicity of the relationship is changed in the model. User can alos set/change the specialization of a given element. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for direct edit action Label of edges and compartments node can’t be edited. Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram. This drag and drop doesn’t perform any semantic modification. Diagrams also allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram. Note that it’s not possible to Drag and drop an element represented as an Edge on the diagram. User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node. Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded. When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted. From the diagram background or from a given node, it’s possible to display all existing elements contained by the initial selection. User just need to display the palette and unfold Existing elements section. User can click on Add existing elements to display elements directly contained by the selection. User can also click on Add existing elements (recursive) to display elements directly contained by the selection and elements contained by these elements and so on. When user select multiple elements, many actions are available to manage all selected element. After user selected some elements, a simplified toolbar is displayed. User can still used basic tools such as : Hide elements, Fade elements, Pin elements. A new tool section appears in this toolbar. Many tools acting on selected elements layout can be found in this tool section : Align left, Align center, Align right, Align top, Align middle, Align bottom, Arrange in row, Arrange in column, Arrange in grid, Distribute horizontal spacing, Distribute vertical spacing, Justify horizontally, Justify vertically, Make same size. In addition to toolbar actions, some actions can be execute with shortcuts. Indeed, after user selected some elements, user can press the key \"Del\" to remove all selected elements. User can also move all selected element on the diagram without changing its graphical or semantic parent.","title":"General view","component":"syson","version":"main","name":"general-view","url":"/syson/main/user-manual/features/general-view.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The Help action, accessible on every page of the application, offers a convenient pathway to navigate to the online help resources for SysON. The Create New Project section is designed to allow users to initiate the creation of a new project. Within the platform, initiating a new project is a user-friendly process that accommodates various preferences: Create a Blank Project: Users can start their modeling journey with an empty project, building a project from the ground up. With blank project, there is no model and no representation at creation. Create a Project from Existing Templates: For efficiency and consistency, users can select from predefined templates that streamline project initiation, aligning with common modeling scenarios. The 3 first possible templates are displayed unitary at the beginning of Project sections and they’re also available in \"Show all templates\" section. For now, there exist two available templates : Batmobile and SysMLv2. Batmobile- template is a complete SysML project with several concepts of each SysML type (kind of _Definitions and Usages with relationships). SysMLv2 is an empty SysML project with only the root model, a Package and a General view representation. Upload a Previously Exported Project: Facilitating collaboration and workflow continuity, users can effortlessly upload a project previously exported, ensuring seamless transitions and flexibility in collaboration. Every project you create have its own Project Editor. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for creating blank projects, generating projects from templates, or uploading existing ones.

The Interconnection view is used to show encapsulated structural contents of _Usage- element: Parts, Properties, Connectors, Ports, and Interfaces. This view in SysON is implemented as an unsynchronized diagram. This means that users need to manually add existing elements to the diagram to visualize them. It doesn’t display all the information stored in the model by default. User can create Interconnection view on any Usage or Definition element. The Diagram panel has global actions grouped in a horizontal toolbar underneath the diagram tabs. This toolbar has the following actions: Display full screen, Fit selection to screen, Zoom group: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Share the diagram link, Export diagram as SVG, Toggle snap to grid, Show helper line to align elements, Arrange all elements, Reveal hidden elements, Reveal faded elements, Unpin all elements. From the root Usage, three elements can be displayed in the Interconnection view diagram: Usage part, port, Annotating elements (Documentation and Comment). From compartment of Usage part, four elements can be displayed in the Interconnection view diagram: documentation, attribute, part, port. The following Relationship can be displayed in the General view diagram: Binding connector as Usage, Allocation, User can create element from the background of the diagram from a simple click that displays palette. In this palette, element creation tool are grouped by type in tool sections according to their type. User can click on the tool section and then click on the desired creation tool. image::manage-elements-fromBackground-creation.png[Creation from Diagram Background] image::manage-elements-fromBackground-creation-2.png[Creation from Diagram Background] The palette has a search field allowing to search in all tool sections. User can also create element in other element. User just clicks on the element to display the toolbar and then click on the desired creation tool. All created element are collapsed by default, it means that if a node with compartment is created, compartment are hidden. If node contains compartment, user can add element in the desired compartment by clicking in the compartment and display the palette. An other way is to click on the parent node header of the compartment. A palette will be display and the user can click on the desired creation tool (inside tool sections), new element will be created in the appropriate compartment. User can only delete a graphical element from the diagram without removing it from the model. User should just click on Delete from diagram button in the palette. User can also remove element from model (and so from diagram) by clicking on Delete from model button in the palette. A confirmation dialog appears when an element is deleted via the Delete from model tool in the palette or via the Model Explorer. This behavior can be disabled by checking the \"Disable this confirmation dialog\" checkbox in the dialog. This preference is stored in the local storage of the browser. You can reset it by deleting the SysON data in cache of your browser. Relationship Edges can be created between Nodes whose types match the Edge’s source and target types. If no edge creation is authorized with a given target, the target node appears faded. When user try to create an edge, user clicks first on the source element to display arrow border. Then user clicks on one of these arrows and stay click until the target. User can see the feedback of the edge and the target node is highlighted. After releasing the click, a pop-up appears and displays all possible kind of edge to create. If only one kind of edge is possible, the edge is directly create without opening the pop-up. it’s not possible for now to create an Edge between two Edges or between an Edge and a Node. Users can reconnect Edges by clicking on the source or target end of the Edge to reconnect, and drag and drop it on a new element. If the new source or the new target isn’t allowed for reconnection, these one will be faded. To delete relationship from model, user should click on the edge and click on the delete button. Remember that relationship edge are always synchronized, it’s not possible to only delete relationship edge from diagram. Containment relationShip isn’t deletable from the diagram. Other relationship can be deletable from the diagram. Keywords on Nodes and Edges are displayed on the first separate line of the label. For example Definition nodes will be prefixed with \"part def\" and Usage node with \"part\". After the keyword, the label can be the simple name of the element, or more complex in some specific cases. Indeed, For example, subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax is supported to describe some element. For simple Definition element, the label will display the keyword \"part def\" and its declared name. For elements using specialization, the label will display the kind of the specilalization. For example, if a Batmobile is a subclassification of Vehicle, its label will display the key word \"part def\" and then \"Batmobile :> Vehicle\" to show its specalization toward Vehicle. If Usage element is given by relationship with multiplicity, the multiplicity value (upper and lower bound) is specified between bracket in the label, just before the specialization. For example, for a Batmobile which contained 4 Wheel by using the Usage wheels then the label will be composed of the keyword \"part\" followed by the name wheels[4] : Wheel which described the Usage wheels with multiplicity 4 defined by the Definition Wheel. For element with compartment node (with list layout), the label of compartment node will be displayed in italic and it will only contained a simple name. No label is defined on edges except in two cases : allocation edge label is specified with its keyword allocate, edge which represent relationship with multiplicity have their multiplicity defined in their label (ex.: containment edge). Element labels can be edited in the following ways: Edit action of the Palette, Press F2, Type directly the new name. With direct edit, user can’t change the keyword but user can change the name. If it’s a simple label, he can rename the element. If user modify the multiplicity defined in the label then the multiplicity of the relationship is changed in the model. User can alos set/change the specialization of a given element. Explore further by referring to the following how-tos for direct edit action Label of edges and compartments node can’t be edited. Users can select elements in the Explorer view and drag and drop them into their container Nodes in the diagram. This drag and drop doesn’t perform any semantic modification. Diagrams also allow semantic drag and drop of any element from the Explorer view (in the same resourceSet as the diagram) on the background of the diagram. Note that it’s not possible to Drag and drop an element represented as an Edge on the diagram. User can select a node on the diagram and drag and drop it in an other container node. Only authorized containers are revealed on the diagram, forbidden targets are faded. When user try to drag and drop a node, the target container node is highlighted. From the diagram background or from a given node, it’s possible to display all existing elements contained by the initial selection. User just need to display the palette and unfold Existing elements section. User can click on Add existing elements to display elements directly contained by the selection. User can also click on Add existing elements (recursive) to display elements directly contained by the selection and elements contained by these elements and so on. When user select multiple elements, many actions are available to manage all selected element. After user selected some elements, a simplified toolbar is displayed. User can still used basic tools such as : Hide elements, Fade elements, Pin elements. A new tool section appears in this toolbar. Many tools acting on selected elements layout can be found in this tool section : Align left, Align center, Align right, Align top, Align middle, Align bottom, Arrange in row, Arrange in column, Arrange in grid, Distribute horizontal spacing, Distribute vertical spacing, Justify horizontally, Justify vertically, Make same size. In addition to toolbar actions, some actions can be execute with shortcuts. Indeed, after user selected some elements, user can press the key \"Del\" to remove all selected elements. User can also move all selected element on the diagram without changing its graphical or semantic parent.","title":"Interconnection view","component":"syson","version":"main","name":"interconnection-view","url":"/syson/main/user-manual/features/interconnection-view.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

However, understanding the scaling limits of the system is essential for planning and optimizing your usage to ensure performance and efficiency. Below, we outline the primary scaling factors and limitations related to model size, semantic elements, representations, project management, and user concurrency. Maximum Model Size: SysON is built to manage large models, but there are practical limits to its capacity. The system can efficiently handle models up to about 10 MB in size. Models larger than this might experience performance degradation, especially in terms of loading times and responsiveness. Impact on Performance: As model size increases, users might meet longer loading times and slower response rates when performing operations such as editing or navigating the model. It’s recommended to break down exceptionally large models into smaller, manageable sub-models where feasible. Element Capacity: SysON can manage models containing up to 150,000 semantic elements. These elements include elements, relationships, and attributes that define the structure and behavior of the model. Performance Considerations: Exceeding this number might lead to increased memory usage and slower query responses. For optimal performance, it’s advisable to maintain a balance and avoid overly complex models that push the upper limit of this capacity. Representation Limits: The system supports up to 2,000 distinct representations per project. Complexity and Usability: While the system can handle a high number of representations, maintaining a clear and organized structure is crucial. Overloading a project with too many representations can complicate navigation and reduce usability. Element Density: A single representation can display up to 1,000 elements. Beyond this, the representation might become cluttered, making it difficult to interpret and work with the visual data. Performance and Visualization: High-density representations may slow down rendering times and interaction speed. It’s beneficial to segment large visualizations into smaller, more focused views to maintain clarity and performance. Project Management: SysON can support up to 1,000 concurrent projects per server. This allows organizations to manage multiple initiatives simultaneously without significant performance degradation. Server Load: The number of projects impacts server load and resource allocation. While the system can support a high number of projects, each project adds to the computational and storage demands, so server capacity should be scaled so. User Capacity: The system is designed to support up to 80 concurrent users on a single server. This capacity ensures that people can collaborate in real-time without encountering significant slowdowns or access issues. Collaboration Dynamics: The performance of collaborative features, such as live editing and real-time updates, might vary depending on the number of users and the complexity of the operations being performed. For larger teams, it’s important to monitor server load and possibly segment users across multiple servers if necessary. Model Partitioning: To manage large models, consider breaking them down into smaller, modular sub-models. This can help maintain performance and make it easier to manage and navigate complex data. Efficient Representations: Limit the number of elements displayed in each representation to avoid clutter and maintain responsiveness. Use multiple, focused representations instead of one overloaded view. Scalable Infrastructure: Ensure that your server infrastructure is scalable to handle increases in project load and user concurrency. This might involve using cloud-based solutions that can dynamically allocate resources as needed. Regular Monitoring: Implement regular monitoring of system performance and user activity to identify and address potential bottlenecks. This can help maintain smooth operation even as the scale of use increases. Contact us for custom solutions: If your needs exceed the outlined limits or you require specific performance optimizations, please contact us. Our team can provide tailored solutions and advice to ensure that SysON meets your scaling requirements effectively.

In the context of Model-Based Systems Engineering - MBSE, where diverse teams contribute to different facets of a project, having an open source tool becomes a unifying force. It allows seamless collaboration and information exchange among stakeholders, regardless of their preferred tools or methodologies. SysON empowers users to seamlessly transition between graphical and textual representations, accommodating diverse modeling preferences and the specific demands of the systems under analysis. This flexibility is crucial in MBSE, where the ability to articulate and refine models in different modalities is instrumental in capturing the complexity inherent in modern system designs. The extensibility of SysML v2 within SysON is a key aspect that reinforces its adaptability to diverse industries and complex project landscapes. In MBSE, where each domain might have unique requirements and specifications, having a tool that can be tailored to meet these specific needs is invaluable. SysON’s extensibility ensures that it remains a dynamic and adaptable resource for system engineers working across various domains. As SysON evolves, guided by the principles of SysML v2, it positions itself as more than just a tool; it evolves into a comprehensive and standardized environment for MBSE endeavors. The commitment to open source and interoperability serves as a cornerstone for future developments, ensuring that SysON continues to meet the evolving needs of the MBSE community. In essence, SysON stands as an open source enabler, promoting collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability—fundamental principles in the ever-evolving landscape of MBSE. SysON extends its utility by introducing the capability to import and export projects in JSON format. This feature enhances interoperability, allowing users to seamlessly exchange project data and collaborate with external tools or platforms. SysON doesn’t support the SysML v2 Standard JSON format for import/export. For detailed instructions on downloading projects, downloading models, uploading projects, and uploading models, please refer to the respective sections in the documentation. These sections provide step-by-step guidance on how to perform these actions within the SysON environment. SysON support SysML v2 textual specifications as an exchange format in order facilitate smooth transitions between tools. This intent reflects SysON’s dedication to staying aligned with evolving industry standards. Add-on has been developed to enable import/export capability to and from SysML v2 textual syntax. This feature provides users with additional flexibility in their modeling workflows. Before importing a file, you need to make sure that all the dependences of this file are also imported, and this, recursively. Otherwise some relationship won’t be resolved. For example if you want to import a file that uses third party libraries, you will need to import the third party libraries before the actual file, otherwise you might have unreferenced relations. Most important SysML v2 concepts can be translated from the imported file, some concept are still under development to enable complete import/export capability from and to SysML v2 textual syntax.

While importing some of the standard examples, there are no more exception mainly when some of examples are linked to non resolved elements. Hide capabilities have been restored and improved in the palette. It’s now possible to hide a node but also all its content (recursive) or simply direct content (Show valued content action). Namespace.getImportedMemberships method now prevents name collisions as stated in the specification (KerML 7.2.5.4 Imports). Non end Usages have been removed from AllocationDefinition ends compartment. Circular containment of nested parts including self containment are now forbidden. Time performance has been improved when using Become nested part edge creation tool. state transition and actions compartments are now available on StateDefinition and StateUsage node. Inherited features in compartments don’t display itself anymore. Add existing element (recursive) behavior has been modified to be more robust and avoid potential exception, mainly the display of nested domain-based edge on State transition view diagram. Composite usages are now forbidden inside PortDefinition/PortUsage. Composite usages are now forbidden inside AttributeDefinition/AttributeUsage. Explicit usage of node to call SysIDE JavaScript file has been added. Membership#visibility attribute has been added to Core properties in the Details view. PortUsage#direction attribute has been added to Core properties in the Details view. Definition/Usage node are now collapsed by default in General view & Action Flow View diagrams. Definition/Usage nodes are expanded in all diagrams when a compartment item is created. All elements are now represented with their icon. Label is now positioned from inside to outside for Ports (Border Nodes). General view diagrams can now be created on any Namespace element. Instead of revealing all compartments of a node when user creates a child in one compartment, only the compartment parent of the child to create is revealed. Other compartments visibility doesn’t change. It’s now possible to create Interconnection view diagrams on any Usage/Definition element. A new compartment with a free-form layout inside the ActionUsage and ActionDefinition nodes is now available. Thanks to this compartment, user can separate Action nodes and connect them by using edges. Remove button is now available on containment edges. \"Add existing elements\" tools have been added on State and StateDefinition graphical elements. Compartments of RequirementDefinition and RequirementUsage have been redesigned to better fit the specification and examples. \"Become nested\" edge creation tools has been added for AttributeUsage, ItemUsage, PartUsage and PortUsage nodes. Creation tools (mainly AttributeUsage, PartUsage, PortUsage ItemUsage) have been added in ActionUsage, ConstraintUsage, InterfaceDefinition, RequirementDefinition and PortUsage. UseCaseDefinition and UseCaseUsage elements are now handled in General view. Composite edges between Usage and compartment content have been added to link nested Actions with its Action, nested Constraints with its Constraints and nested Constraints with its Requirement. OccurrenceDefinition and OccurrenceUsage elements are now handled in General view. Reconnection tools have been added for composition edges. AllocationDefinition and AllocationUsage elements are now handled in General view. A service that serializes a SysML element to its textual representation defined by the OMG Standard is now available and used in export capability. ConjugatedPortDefinition is now handled in diagrams, Explorer and Details View. It’s now possible to create and manipulate Interface edges in Interconnection view diagram. State Transition view diagrams are now available on Package elements. Inherited features are now taken into account in features compartments. AcceptAction elements are now handled in General view diagram. PortUsage in Interconnection View are now represented with rotative image. Whatever its border support, the PortUsage node is always represented by an arrow pointing inside the parent node. It’s now possible to represent and handle Succession edges between Actions in General view diagram, from background diagram but also from action flow compartment.","title":"2024.5.0","component":"syson","version":"main","name":"2024.5.0","url":"/syson/main/user-manual/release-notes/2024.5.0.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

All redefines references of the SysMLv2 metamodel have been implemented. The textual import running process have been improved. By default, end users don’t have to copy syside-cli.js near the syson-application jar anymore. The embedded syside-cli.js is copied in a system temp folder and executed from there (with node). But, if you encounter execution rights problem, you can still copy syside-cli.js in a place where you have the appropriate rights and use the org.eclipse.syson.syside.path application option.

Fix an issue where a click on inherited members inside compartments was raising an error instead of displaying the palette. Fix an issue where non-containment references in standard libraries weren’t correctly imported into the project’s editing context. Remove owning Usage memberships from inherited memberships of Usages. Memberships of a Type are inherited via Specialization or Conjugation, not by composition. Fix an issue that allowed to drop an element from the explorer or the diagram on one of its children. Doing so deleted both the dropped element and its children from the diagram, and could delete the representation if one of the element was the root element of the representation. Fix an issue that made the direct edit not working on Constraint and Requirement elements. Fix an issue that made the addExistingElements not work properly for start and done actions inside actions and parts. Fix an issue on constraint expression name resolution that prevented from referencing elements in other containing namespaces than the direct owner of the constraint. It is now possible to reference an element in any of the containing namespaces of the constraint. Fix an issue that deleted the content of an action when it was dropped from the diagram to an action flow compartment. Fix an issue where it was impossible anymore to set the cardinality of an Element as graphical node through direct edit. Fix an issue where ConjugatedPortDefinition labels were rendered as null instead of their actual name. Fix an issue that made direct edit of names not working on nodes in the Interconnection View diagram. Fix an issue that revealed the documentation compartment when dropping an element on itself. The drop isn’t allowed anymore, and a warning message is displayed. Fix an issue that deleted feature typing specialization when nesting a PartUsage in a PartDefinition. The tool Add Part as nested Part now correctly keeps the existing relationships of the PartUsage after its owner is changed. Fix an issue that prevented the drop of the root element of a diagram on its background. Fix an issue that made all the elements references when imported by the SysMLParser. Add actions in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add states in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add ExhibitStates on General View diagram Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a PartUsage/PartDefinition Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a StateUsage/StateDefinition The InterfaceUsage created by the New Interface edge tool in the Interconnection View diagram are now created under closest containing Definition/Package. Simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram and remove duplicated code Add action node in Interconnection View diagram Add documentation and action flow compartments for action nodes in the Interconnection View diagram Add label support for referential Usages Nodes that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword Elements in lists that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword AttributeUsage do not contain the \"ref\" keyword since they are always referential Add support for \"ref\" keyword in direct edit Prefixing the name of an Usage with \"ref\" sets it as a reference Not setting the \"ref\" prefix of an Usage sets it as a composite (non-reference) Use empty diamond source style for nested reference usage edge Nested usages that are composite are connected by a filled diamond edge Nested usages that are references are connected by an empty diamond edge Modify the creation of an ExhibitState from a StateUsage or StateDefinition. There is now several tools for creating an ExhibitState. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. Display qualified names in diagrams nodes' labels in case of standard libraries elements. Allow to select existing Action on Perform tool. Allow to set measurement units via direct edit. It is now possible to configure the measurement unit for the value of an element, e.g. mass = 10 [kg]. Allow to select existing Type on Subject tool. Display prefix keywords in label for Usage compartment element Display multiplicity suffix property keywords in label for Usage element Allow direct edit of prefix keywords and multiplicity suffix for Usage elements Prefixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with direction or \"abstract\" or \"variation\" or \"readonly\" or \"derived\" or \"end\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Suffixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with \"ordered\" or \"nonunique\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Add support for constraint expressions in the general view. Constraints with expressions such as mass >= 10 [kg] are now correctly parsed and the corresponding semantic objects are created in the constraint. Add actors compartment in UseCase and Requirement in the General View diagram. Handle the representation of actors on the General View diagram. Actors are represented with a stick figure image, with their label displayed below the image. Add support for edges between actors and their containing UseCase/Requirement in the General View diagram. The source of the edge (the UseCase or Requirement) can be reconnected to another UseCase or Requirement, but the target (Actor) cannot be reconnected. Allow to select existing RequirementUsage and RequirementDefinition on Objective tool. Add a check to make the build fail if a Cypress test contains it.only. Add support for public import in direct edit specializations. It is now possible to specialize an element with a qualified name containing namespaces importing the required features. For example, myAttribute : ISQ::MassValue now correctly types the attribute with ISQBase::MassValue. Improve the support of root Namespaces in SysON documents. Root Namespaces are now implicitly created at the root of SysON documents. Creating an element at the root of a SysON document now creates it in its root Namespace. A new filter is available to hide root Namespaces and is enabled by default. It is no longer possible to create Namespace from the explorer. It is no longer possible to create a representation on a root Namespace. Improve the drop from the explorer to ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed. Display prefix keywords in labels of Definitions and Usages graphical nodes. Ensure that dropping an element from the explorer on the diagram reveals the corresponding node if it is already on the diagram and hidden. A warning message is now displayed when attempting to drop an element which is already displayed and visible in the target container. Ignore keywords order during direct edit of prefixes labels of Definitions and Usages graphical elements. DirectEdit on graphical node or list item authorized only to modify keywords which can be displayed in each label. Allow to drop a Definition from the explorer on an Usage on a diagram or in a list compartment to type it. Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package. Add \"Show/Hide Icons in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide icons in the diagrams (icons are not part of the SysMLv2 specification). Add new tools allowing to create an ExhibitState at the root of General View and StateTransition View. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. The selected State will be added to the diagram, not the new ExhibitState. Handle FlowConnectionUsage between PortUsages in Interconnection View. A new edge tool allows to create a flow between two ports. Add tools to set a Feature as composite or reference. Handle ItemUsage in Interconnection View and FlowConnectionUsage using items as their source/target. Add documentation property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a documentation for the selected element. This property widget will only handle the first documentation associated to the selected element. If no documentation is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a Documentation element and will associate it to the selected element. Add new \"New objects from text\" menu entry on elements in Explorer view, allowing to insert textual SysMLv2 as objects under the selected element. The menu entry shows a dialog with a textarea allowing to write or paste textual SysMLv2. A click on the Insert button converts the textual SysMLv2 into model elements and add them under the selected element. Improve the drag and drop of container elements to move their content. Handle implicit specializations from standard libraries for Usages/Definitions. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from users models in diagrams. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members from Standard Libraries in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from standard libraries in diagrams.","title":"2024.9.0","component":"syson","version":"main","name":"2024.9.0","url":"/syson/main/user-manual/release-notes/2024.9.0.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Add CaseUsage and CaseDefinition in General View diagram, the following classes have been renamed to reflect their new usage: Rename UseCaseDefinitionActorsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider to CaseDefinitionActorsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider Rename UseCaseDefinitionObjectiveRequirementCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider to CaseDefinitionObjectiveRequirementCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider Rename UseCaseDefinitionSubjectCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider to CaseDefinitionSubjectCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider Rename UseCaseUsageActorsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider to CaseUsageActorsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider Rename UseCaseUsageObjectiveRequirementCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider to CaseUsageObjectiveRequirementCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider Rename UseCaseUsageSubjectCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider to CaseUsageSubjectCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider Handle of aliases and external references have been improved for textual import, the following methods have been deleted: Deleted AstTreeParser#resolveAllImport Deleted AstTreeParser#resolveAllReference Deleted ProxyResolver#resolveAllProxy Add an edge tool to add target element as nested usage. The following methods have been moved from NodeCreationTestsService to SemanticCheckerService to better separate testing concerns: getElementInParentSemanticChecker checkEditingContext The following methods have been moved from NodeCreationTestsService to DiagramCheckerService to better separate testing concerns: getChildNodeGraphicalChecker getCompartmentNodeGraphicalChecker getSiblingNodeGraphicalChecker checkDiagram Remove default name of relationships and improve edge labels. The method getSuccessionLabel in ViewLabelService has been deleted, succession labels are now computed with the generic getEdgeLabel method. Allow the drop of elements on empty diagram nodes. Rename the class SemanticCheckerFactory to SemanticRunnableFactory to reflect the new use cases of the class. Align metamodel to SysMLv2 and KerML Beta 2.2 specifications. The changes are: Import visibility attribute default value is now private instead of public Type inheritedMemberships operation now have a second parameter, excludeImplied : boolean Feature new featureTarget : Feature derived reference new typingFeatures : List<Feature> operation InvocationExpression new operand : List>Expression> derived reference AnalysisCaseUsage remove analysisAction : ActionUsage reference AnalysisCaseDefinition remove analysisAction : ActionUsage reference Extract direct edit grammar from services module into separate module (new syson-direct-edit-grammar module). Switch to Spring Boot 3.3.3 Migrate the frontend to react 18.3.1, react-dom 18.3.1, react-router-dom 6.26.0, @xstate/react: 3.0.0 and @ObeoNetwork/gantt-task-react 0.6.0 Switch to Sirius Web 2024.11.0 Switch to the final release version of AQL 8.0.2 Switch to @ObeoNetwork/gantt-task-react 0.6.1 to benefit for enhancements Add a dependency to material-react-table \"2.13.3\" and export-to-csv \"1.3.0\" Switch to commons-io 2.17 Switch to java-uuid-generator 5.1.0 Switch to SysIDE 0.6.2 Fix an issue that prevented the import of Allocation and AllocationDefinition. Fix import of some boolean attributes (Type#isAbstract, Feature#isDerived, Feature#isEnd, Feature#isReadOnly). Fix an issue where the import failed to resolve redefinedFeature references when the Redefinition had no name. Fix an issue where InterfaceUsage and FlowConnectionUsage elements might be created inside the wrong membership in the Interconnection View diagram. Add declaredName attribute in AnnotatingElement (if present) in export to textual SysMLv2. Fix visibility issue when resolving name of privately imported element during export. Fix an issue where it was impossible anymore to delete the cardinality of a Usage as graphical node through direct edit. Fix an issue where Subsetting elements were not deleted at the same time as the deletion of their subsetted Feature. Add CaseUsage and CaseDefinition representations in the General View diagram. Update Batmobile template. Handle of aliases and external references have been improved for textual import. Add support for short name in container and compartment item labels. Allow to set short name via the direct edit. Make Declared Short Name accessible from the Core tab instead of the Advanced tab in the details view. Remove default name of relationships and improve edge labels. Allow to create dependencies from the Explorer view. Allow the drop of elements on empty diagram nodes. It is now possible to drop elements from the explorer on the information box visible on empty diagrams. The dropped element is displayed on the diagram, the same way element creation tools on the information box display them on the diagram. Exclude src/test/resources from checkstyle. This reduces the time required to build SysON, especially when using Spring Tool Suite. Add New Subsetting tool on PartUsage to create a Subsetting edge and a PartUsage that is subset. Add New Feature Typing tool on PartUsage to create a FeatureTyping edge and a PartDefinition. Add New Binding Connector As Usage tool on PartUsage in Interconnection View diagram. Add New Flow Connection tool on PartUsage in Interconnection View diagram. Add New Interface tool on PartUsage in Interconnection View diagram. Handle UseCaseUsage and IncludeUseCaseUsage elements in export to textual SysMLv2. All standard libraries have been updated to comply with the SysML Beta 2.2 specification. Improve import feature non regression tests. Added source sysml file and unaltered ast.json result. Add a new Custom node representing à Note among possible node style descriptions available. The custom node is resizable and the text content is wrapped (back to the line) if it is too long compare to the node size. Represent Documentation as Note graphical node. The Documentation graphical node can appear when user drag and drop Documentation element from explorer on the diagram. The Documentation graphical node is linked to its documented element by an edge and the node can only appear if the documented element is represented on the diagram. Display prefix keywords in labels of Documentation graphical nodes. Allow creation of Comment from the Explorer view. Add Comment representation in graphical views. The Comment graphical node can appear when user drag and drop Comment element from explorer on the diagram but also when user handle creation tool from the palette. The Comment graphical node is linked to its annotated element by an edge and the node can only appear if the annotated element is represented on the diagram. Display prefix keywords in labels of Comment graphical nodes. Add Comment property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a Comment for the selected element. This property widget will only handle the first Comment associated to the selected element. If no Comment is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a Comment element and will associate it to the selected element. Add an edge tool to add target element as nested usage. This complements the existing tool that allows to add the source element as a nested usage of the target. Introduce SysMLv2 REST APIs. In this first implementation we will only implement the following REST APIs, thanks to Sirius Web: Project-related REST APIs: getProjects (GET /api/rest/projects): Get all projects. getProjectById (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}): Get project with the given id (projectId). createProject (POST /projects): Create a new project with the given name and description (optional). deleteProject (DELETE /api/rest/projects/{projectId}): Delete the project with the given id (projectId). updateProject (PUT /projects/{projectId}): Update the project with the given id (projectId). Object-related REST APIs. getElements (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements): Get all the elements in a given project at the given commit. There are no commits in Sirius Web so you can use the same Id as the projectId for the commitId. getElementById (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements/{elementId}): Get element with the given id (elementId) in the given project at the given commit. There are no commits in Sirius Web so you can use the same Id as the projectId for the commitId. getRelationshipsByRelatedElement (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/elements/{elementId}/relationships): Get relationships that are incoming, outgoing, or both relative to the given related element. There are no commits in Sirius Web so you can use the same Id as the projectId for the commitId. getRootElements (GET /api/rest/projects/{projectId}/commits/{commitId}/roots): Get all the root elements in the given project at the given commit. There are no commits in Sirius Web so you can use the same Id as the projectId for the commitId. Model conformance to SysMLv2 Beta 2 version: the metamodel has been modified to conform to SysMLv2 Beta 2 specification released on the 3rd of February 2024(see https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/ for more details) and KerML Beta 2 specification released on the 17the of February 2024(see https://www.omg.org/spec/KerML/ for more details). New \"New objects from text\" menu entry: from elements in Explorer view, allow to insert textual SysMLv2 as objects under the selected element. The menu entry shows a dialog with a textarea allowing to write or paste textual SysMLv2. A click on the Insert button converts the textual SysMLv2 into model elements and add them under the selected element. New \"Show/Hide Icons in Diagrams\" diagram panel entry: from panel in Diagrams, allow to show or hide the icons of diagrams elements. New \"Show/Hide Inherited Members in Diagrams\" diagram panel entry: from panel in Diagrams, allow to show or hide the inherited members from users models in diagrams.

Move StateTransitionCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider from syson-diagram-statetransition-view to module syson-diagram-common-view. Code refactoring: Rename ExhibitStatesCompartmentItemNodeDescriptionProvider to StatesCompartmentItemNodeDescriptionProvider. StatesCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider now handles both exhibit and non-exhibit states. Align metamodel to SysMLv2 Beta 2 specification released on the 3rd of February 2024(see https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/ for more details) and KerML Beta 2 specification released on the 17the of February 2024(see https://www.omg.org/spec/KerML/ for more details). You may have to fix your existing SysON models/projects by your own means to still be able to open them with SysON. Please download all your models/projects before upgrading to 2024.9.0. The changes are: AnnotatingElement add derived reference \"ownedAnnotatingRelationship : Annotation\" Annotation add derived reference \"owningAnnotatingElement : AnnotatingElement\" Connector remove attribute \"isDirected : boolean\" OperatorExpression remove derived reference \"operand : Expression\" ParameterMembership add operation \"parameterDirection() : FeatureDirectionKind\" Type add operation \"directionOfExcluding(Feature, Type[0..\\*]) : FeatureDirectionKind\" Refactor and simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram, the following classes have been deleted, renamed, or merged: Deleted InterconnectionViewForDefinitionDescriptionProvider Deleted InterconnectionViewForDefinitionDiagramDescriptionProvider Deleted InterconnectionViewForUsageDiagramDescriptionProvider Merged RootUsageNodeDescriptionProvider and RootDefinitionNodeDescriptionProvider into RootNodeDescriptionProvider Renamed FirstLevelChildPartUsageNodeDescriptionProvider to FirstLevelChildUsageNodeDescriptionProvider Renamed ChildPartUsageNodeDescriptionProvider to ChildUsageNodeDescriptionProvider Switch to Sirius Web 2024.7.1: all diagrams must be deleted and created again, due to the fix of this Sirius Web bug.

Ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed, the following methods have been moved to support this feature The method ToolService#dropElementFromExplorer has been moved to ViewToolService since it now requires view-related imports that motivated this refactoring. The method ToolService#dropElementFromDiagram has been moved to ViewToolService for the sake of consistency. Fix Add Existing Elements tool for start and done actions, the following methods have been moved to UtilService to make them reusable by different services (they are now used by ViewNodeService and ViewToolService): ViewNodeService#getAllStandardStartActions ViewNodeService#getAllStandardDoneActions ViewNodeService#isAction ViewNodeService#isPart Split DiagramDirectEditListener#exitExpression directEdit service into two services : exitNodeExpression and exitListItemExpression to specify the grahical context of use . Add new boolean parameter isCompartmentItem to the LabelService#directEdit service to clarify the graphical element type to edit. Rename LabelService#getUsagePrefix into getUsageListItemPrefix to specify the computation of this prefix on list item elements. Rename ViewLabelService#getInitialDirectEditLabel service into getInitialDirectEditListItemLabel to specify the computation of the initial label on list item elements. Fix an issue that revealed the documentation compartment when dropping an element on itself, the following method’s contract has been updated as part of the fix: EMFUtils#isAncestor(parent, eObject) now returns true if parent == eObject. Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package, the tool Create Package is not available in Action Flow View diagrams anymore. Switch to Sirius Web 2024.9.0 Migrate frontend to MUI 5 Switch to maven-checkstyle-plugin 3.4.0 Switch to Spring Boot 3.3.1 Add a dependency to CycloneDX to compute the backend software bill of materials during the build Add a dependency to pathfinding Prevent nested part to be rendered as border nodes in the Interconnection View diagram. Fix an issue where a click on inherited members inside compartments was raising an error instead of displaying the palette. Fix an issue where non-containment references in standard libraries weren’t correctly imported into the project’s editing context. Remove owning Usage memberships from inherited memberships of Usages. Memberships of a Type are inherited via Specialization or Conjugation, not by composition. Fix an issue that allowed to drop an element from the explorer or the diagram on one of its children. Doing so deleted both the dropped element and its children from the diagram, and could delete the representation if one of the element was the root element of the representation. Fix an issue that made the direct edit not working on Constraint and Requirement elements. Fix an issue that made the addExistingElements not work properly for start and done actions inside actions and parts. Fix an issue on constraint expression name resolution that prevented from referencing elements in other containing namespaces than the direct owner of the constraint. It is now possible to reference an element in any of the containing namespaces of the constraint. Fix an issue that deleted the content of an action when it was dropped from the diagram to an action flow compartment. Fix an issue where it was impossible anymore to set the cardinality of an Element as graphical node through direct edit. Fix an issue where ConjugatedPortDefinition labels were rendered as null instead of their actual name. Fix an issue that made direct edit of names not working on nodes in the Interconnection View diagram. Fix an issue that revealed the documentation compartment when dropping an element on itself. The drop isn’t allowed anymore, and a warning message is displayed. Fix an issue that deleted feature typing specialization when nesting a PartUsage in a PartDefinition. The tool Add Part as nested Part now correctly keeps the existing relationships of the PartUsage after its owner is changed. Fix an issue that prevented the drop of the root element of a diagram on its background. Fix an issue that made all the elements references when imported by the SysMLParser. Add actions in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add states in PartUsage and PartDefinition Add ExhibitStates on General View diagram Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a PartUsage/PartDefinition Allow the creation of a StateTransitionView diagram on a StateUsage/StateDefinition The InterfaceUsage created by the New Interface edge tool in the Interconnection View diagram are now created under closest containing Definition/Package. Simplify the implementation of the Interconnection View diagram and remove duplicated code Add action node in Interconnection View diagram Add documentation and action flow compartments for action nodes in the Interconnection View diagram Add label support for referential Usages Nodes that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword Elements in lists that are references now correctly contain the \"ref\" keyword AttributeUsage do not contain the \"ref\" keyword since they are always referential Add support for \"ref\" keyword in direct edit Prefixing the name of an Usage with \"ref\" sets it as a reference Not setting the \"ref\" prefix of an Usage sets it as a composite (non-reference) Use empty diamond source style for nested reference usage edge Nested usages that are composite are connected by a filled diamond edge Nested usages that are references are connected by an empty diamond edge Modify the creation of an ExhibitState from a StateUsage or StateDefinition. There is now several tools for creating an ExhibitState. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. Display qualified names in diagrams nodes' labels in case of standard libraries elements. Allow to select existing Action on Perform tool. Allow to set measurement units via direct edit. It is now possible to configure the measurement unit for the value of an element, e.g. mass = 10 [kg]. Allow to select existing Type on Subject tool. Display prefix keywords in label for Usage compartment element Display multiplicity suffix property keywords in label for Usage element Allow direct edit of prefix keywords and multiplicity suffix for Usage elements Prefixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with direction or \"abstract\" or \"variation\" or \"readonly\" or \"derived\" or \"end\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Suffixing or not the name of an Usage attribute with \"ordered\" or \"nonunique\" (this order counts) sets its matching property with the correct value Add support for constraint expressions in the general view. Constraints with expressions such as mass >= 10 [kg] are now correctly parsed and the corresponding semantic objects are created in the constraint. Add actors compartment in UseCase and Requirement in the General View diagram. Handle the representation of actors on the General View diagram. Actors are represented with a stick figure image, with their label displayed below the image. Add support for edges between actors and their containing UseCase/Requirement in the General View diagram. The source of the edge (the UseCase or Requirement) can be reconnected to another UseCase or Requirement, but the target (Actor) cannot be reconnected. Allow to select existing RequirementUsage and RequirementDefinition on Objective tool. Add a check to make the build fail if a Cypress test contains it.only. Add support for public import in direct edit specializations. It is now possible to specialize an element with a qualified name containing namespaces importing the required features. For example, myAttribute : ISQ::MassValue now correctly types the attribute with ISQBase::MassValue. Improve the support of root Namespaces in SysON documents. Root Namespaces are now implicitly created at the root of SysON documents. Creating an element at the root of a SysON document now creates it in its root Namespace. A new filter is available to hide root Namespaces and is enabled by default. It is no longer possible to create Namespace from the explorer. It is no longer possible to create a representation on a root Namespace. Improve the drop from the explorer to ensure that dropped nodes are always collapsed. Display prefix keywords in labels of Definitions and Usages graphical nodes. Ensure that dropping an element from the explorer on the diagram reveals the corresponding node if it is already on the diagram and hidden. A warning message is now displayed when attempting to drop an element which is already displayed and visible in the target container. Ignore keywords order during direct edit of prefixes labels of Definitions and Usages graphical elements. DirectEdit on graphical node or list item authorized only to modify keywords which can be displayed in each label. Allow to drop a Definition from the explorer on an Usage on a diagram or in a list compartment to type it. Allow to create an Action Flow View diagram on an ActionDefinition or ActionUsage in addition to Package. Add \"Show/Hide Icons in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide icons in the diagrams (icons are not part of the SysMLv2 specification). Add new tools allowing to create an ExhibitState at the root of General View and StateTransition View. The first one called \"New ExhibitState\" creates a simple ExhibitState. The second one called \"New ExhibitState with referenced State\" shows a dialog allowing to select an existing State to associate to the new ExhibitState. The selected State will be added to the diagram, not the new ExhibitState. Handle FlowConnectionUsage between PortUsages in Interconnection View. A new edge tool allows to create a flow between two ports. Add tools to set a Feature as composite or reference. Handle ItemUsage in Interconnection View and FlowConnectionUsage using items as their source/target. Add documentation property to Core tab of the Details view, allowing to add/edit a documentation for the selected element. This property widget will only handle the first documentation associated to the selected element. If no documentation is associated to the selected element, then a new value in this widget will also create a Documentation element and will associate it to the selected element. Add new \"New objects from text\" menu entry on elements in Explorer view, allowing to insert textual SysMLv2 as objects under the selected element. The menu entry shows a dialog with a textarea allowing to write or paste textual SysMLv2. A click on the Insert button converts the textual SysMLv2 into model elements and add them under the selected element. Improve the drag and drop of container elements to move their content. Handle implicit specializations from standard libraries for Usages/Definitions. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from users models in diagrams. Add \"Show/Hide Inherited Members from Standard Libraries in Diagrams\" action in Diagram Panel, allowing to show/hide inherited members from standard libraries in diagrams. Expanded Diagram and Model Support: We’ve significantly expanded our support for various elements and tools.

These improvements help maintain the integrity and accuracy of semantic data. Add standard libraries and new models now have a root Namespace to conform with KerML/SysML specifications. Generalization of StateTransition descriptions. Rename AbstractDiagramDescriptionProvider nameGenerator as descriptionNameGenerator. Impacted concrete implementations: ActionFlowViewDiagramDescriptionProvider, GeneralViewDiagramDescriptionProvider, InterconnectionViewForDefinitionDiagramDescriptionProvider, InterconnectionViewForUsageDiagramDescriptionProvider, StateTransitionViewDiagramDescriptionProvider. Rename syson-diagram-statetransition-view CompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider as StateTransitionActionsCompartmentNodeDescriptionProvider. StateTransitionViewEdgeService removed, services moved to ViewEdgeService and ViewLabelService. StateTransitionActionToolProvider moved to syson-diagram-common-view StateTransitionCompartmentNodeToolProvider moved to syson-diagram-common-view createState and createOwnedAction services moved to ViewToolService Switch to sirius-web domain driven design architecture. Please download your existing SysON projects before moving to this new version. A reset of the database is needed. Code refactoring: Move AbstractDiagramDescriptionProvider#createNodeToolFromDiagramBackground(NodeDescription, EClassifier) to new ToolDescriptionService Move AbstractViewElementDescriptionProvider#addExistingElementsTool(boolean) to new ToolDescriptionService Remove AbstractViewElementDescriptionProvider Move createDropFromExplorerTool to new ToolDescriptionService Move and rename AbstractDiagramDescriptionProvider.addElementsToolSection(IViewDiagramElementFinder) to ToolDescriptionService#addElementsDiagramToolSection() Move and rename AbstractNodeDescriptionProvider#addExistingElementsTool() to ToolDescriptionService#addElementsNodeToolSection() Remove AbstractDiagramDescriptionProvider Rename StateTransitionActionToolProvider to StateTransitionActionCompartmentToolProvider Move AbstractViewNodeToolSectionSwitch#buildCreateSection(NodeTool…​) to ToolDescriptionService#buildCreateSection(NodeTool…​) Merge AbstractViewNodeToolSectionSwitch#addElementsToolSection() and AbstractViewNodeToolSectionSwitch#addExistingNestedElementsTool() in ToolDescriptionService#addElementsNodeToolSection(boolean) ViewLabelService#getCompartmentItemUsageLabel has been renamed to ViewLabelService#getCompartmentItemLabel.

Allow the creation of sub-Packages in the model explorer Add root Namespace to SysON models and libraries to conform to SysMLv2 specification. Improve support for whitespace, quotes, and special characters in direct edit. Handle start and done actions in Action Flow View & General View diagrams. Add State and StateDefinition in the General View diagram. Add Transition source and target to Core properties in the Details view. All redefines references of the SysMLv2 metamodel have been implemented. The textual import running process have been improved. By default, end users don’t have to copy syside-cli.js near the syson-application jar anymore. The embedded syside-cli.js is copied in a system temp folder and executed from there (with node). But, if you encounter execution rights problem, you can still copy syside-cli.js in a place where you have the appropriate rights and use the org.eclipse.syson.syside.path application option. Property \"Typed by\" is now always visible in the Details view for Feature elements, even if the Feature doesn’t have a type yet. Rename creation tools for Start and Done actions (from Add Start/Done to New Start/Done) Reduce the default height of the Package node in diagrams Move Feature#direction in Core properties tab of the Details view Sort New Object menu entries Add Direct Edit tool in Control (ForkNode, JoinNode…​) nodes palettes Allow multiple occurrences of Start and Done actions in actions compartments. Rewrite textual import. It is still an experimental feature but should now be faster and accurate. Rewrite the addExistingElement tool. The tool now works correctly on packages, and doesn’t render sibling elements when their semantic element has been rendered by another node (e.g. in a compartment). The empty/null values for Subsetting/Redefinition/Subclassification/FeatureTyping are not displayed anymore in diagram node labels. Add tools for creating Ports with direction Add tools for creation Items with direction Change the default name of the transition element to source_to_target Provide new icons for State, Conjugation, Port (in,in/out,out) and Item (in,in/out,out). Add tools to create Items and Parts in Port and PortDefinition Add tool to create Requirements in RequirementDefinition Add tools for creating Items on ActionDefinition in GeneralView and ActionFlowView. AcceptAction is now available inside an Action body Add private and protected visibility decorators on all elements Add Cypress test infrastructure and execute the Cypress tests as part of pull request checks. Add integration test infrastructure Initial contribution of this documentation Handle the JoinNode, MergeNode, ForkNode, DecisionNode elements in actions compartments. Handle the ExhibitState elements in diagrams Add new documentation compartment on all existing nodes in all diagrams. Expanded Diagram and Model Support: We’ve significantly expanded our support for various views, including the addition of representations for use cases, occurrences, and allocations. This enhancement provides more comprehensive tools to visualize and manage SysML v2 models. This includes the addition of diagrams for use cases, occurrences, and allocations. Improved User Experience: We’ve improved how elements are displayed, particularly in terms of ports and compartments. These enhancements ensure a clearer and more intuitive user interface. Increased Stability and Reliability: We’ve addressed several key bugs and stability issues including fixing problems with diagrams and import capabilities. These improvements help maintain the integrity and accuracy of semantic data. First Export Capability: Our enhanced integration of SysIDE now supports better integration of the SysML v2 format. We’re now able to export projects in the standard textual format, facilitating easier data sharing and compatibility with other industry-standard tools. This promotes better data exchange and collaboration. The requirement-view diagram has been introduced by error in the last release. This diagram isn’t defined in the SysMLv2 specification. It has been deleted in this release. Switch to Sirius Web v2024.5.0 Switch to @ObeoNetwork/gantt-task-react 0.4.9 Add dependency to org.apache.commons.commons-text 1.10.0 The \"Add existing elements (recursive)\" has been modified to work on PartUsage. From Interconnection view diagram, attributes compartment has been added in children PartUsage nodes. No error is raised anymore when setting a valid new value (with primitive type) in the Details view. The body feature of a Comment remove now the \"/*\" and \"*/\" characters while importing a model from SysML textual format. All Memberships are now contained in their parent through ownedRelatedElement instead of ownedRelationship reference. Rename action from explorer is now renaming tree items as expected. EnumerationDefinition is now created with a default name. \"Add existing element (recursive)\" action has been updated to create child nodes for nested and owned usages at the root of the diagram. While importing some of the standard examples, there are no more exception mainly when some of examples are linked to non resolved elements. Hide capabilities have been restored and improved in the palette. It’s now possible to hide a node but also all its content (recursive) or simply direct content (Show valued content action). Namespace.getImportedMemberships method now prevents name collisions as stated in the specification (KerML 7.2.5.4 Imports). Non end Usages have been removed from AllocationDefinition ends compartment. Circular containment of nested parts including self containment are now forbidden. Time performance has been improved when using Become nested part edge creation tool. state transition and actions compartments are now available on StateDefinition and StateUsage node. Inherited features in compartments don’t display itself anymore. Add existing element (recursive) behavior has been modified to be more robust and avoid potential exception, mainly the display of nested domain-based edge on State transition view diagram. Composite usages are now forbidden inside PortDefinition/PortUsage. Composite usages are now forbidden inside AttributeDefinition/AttributeUsage. Explicit usage of node to call SysIDE JavaScript file has been added. Membership#visibility attribute has been added to Core properties in the Details view. PortUsage#direction attribute has been added to Core properties in the Details view. Definition/Usage node are now collapsed by default in General view & Action Flow View diagrams. Definition/Usage nodes are expanded in all diagrams when a compartment item is created. All elements are now represented with their icon. Label is now positioned from inside to outside for Ports (Border Nodes). General view diagrams can now be created on any Namespace element. Instead of revealing all compartments of a node when user creates a child in one compartment, only the compartment parent of the child to create is revealed. Other compartments visibility doesn’t change. It’s now possible to create Interconnection view diagrams on any Usage/Definition element. A new compartment with a free-form layout inside the ActionUsage and ActionDefinition nodes is now available. Thanks to this compartment, user can separate Action nodes and connect them by using edges. Remove button is now available on containment edges. \"Add existing elements\" tools have been added on State and StateDefinition graphical elements. Compartments of RequirementDefinition and RequirementUsage have been redesigned to better fit the specification and examples. \"Become nested\" edge creation tools has been added for AttributeUsage, ItemUsage, PartUsage and PortUsage nodes. Creation tools (mainly AttributeUsage, PartUsage, PortUsage ItemUsage) have been added in ActionUsage, ConstraintUsage, InterfaceDefinition, RequirementDefinition and PortUsage. UseCaseDefinition and UseCaseUsage elements are now handled in General view. Composite edges between Usage and compartment content have been added to link nested Actions with its Action, nested Constraints with its Constraints and nested Constraints with its Requirement. OccurrenceDefinition and OccurrenceUsage elements are now handled in General view. Reconnection tools have been added for composition edges. AllocationDefinition and AllocationUsage elements are now handled in General view. A service that serializes a SysML element to its textual representation defined by the OMG Standard is now available and used in export capability. ConjugatedPortDefinition is now handled in diagrams, Explorer and Details View. It’s now possible to create and manipulate Interface edges in Interconnection view diagram. State Transition view diagrams are now available on Package elements. Inherited features are now taken into account in features compartments. AcceptAction elements are now handled in General view diagram. PortUsage in Interconnection View are now represented with rotative image. Whatever its border support, the PortUsage node is always represented by an arrow pointing inside the parent node. It’s now possible to represent and handle Succession edges between Actions in General view diagram, from background diagram but also from action flow compartment. Improved User Interactivity: New features such as direct editing allow users to change element details seamlessly, without data loss. This enhances the overall user experience by making it more intuitive and reducing the time required to make changes. Expanded Library and Standard Support: All KerML and SysML v2 standard libraries are now included by default. This expands the tool’s capabilities and ensures compatibility with industry standards, making it easier to integrate and reference standard elements in projects. Advanced Filtering: New filters have been added to the Explorer view, allowing users to hide specific elements and libraries, which simplifies the interface and focuses on relevant data. Import Capabilities: Additionally, SysML v2 textual files can now be imported directly, enhancing data integration and compatibility with other tools. Enhanced Diagram Development: We’ve restructured and streamlined our diagrams implementation, including the introduction of specific modules and tools for better cross-diagram functionality. This ensures that all graphical representations are more cohesive and easier to maintain. Node Descriptions Providers in General View has been modified with mainly rename of these providers to match with all Definitions and Usages Node Descriptions. After switch to Sirius Web v2024.3.0, GeneralViewRegistryConfigurer has been renamed to GeneralViewDescriptionProvider. SysMLv2ObjectService has been renamed into SysMLv2LabelService as it now implements ILabelServiceDelegate instead of IObjectServiceDelegate. Refactor diagrams code with creation of the diagram-common-view module to gather all cross diagram tools and there is now one name generator per diagram owning the diagram prefix used to prefix all descriptions for this diagram. commons-io 2.11.0 dependency has been explicitly added in syson-application-configuration. Switch to Sirius Web v2024.3.0 By activating direct Edit, User can now change the name/type/value/range of an element without any lost. The direct edit of labels in diagrams now handles partial edition. When user wants to create new elements under a selected element, only provides candidates that will make sense are proposed among new objects candidates in Explorer view menu. The creation of elements with their containing Membership is now done in one click. A recursive version of the Add existing elements tool is now available to display all the cluster of objects contained in a selected node. Package node headers' width has been improved to better handle longer labels. It’s now impossible to have Package children overlapping the Package node body’s west border. All KerML and SysML standard libraries have been added in project definition. These libraries aren’t visible in the Explorer. Users can reference these libraries elements from the Details view or through the direct edit of elements in diagrams. Tools names have been renamed by adding spaces between type words and removing \"Usage\" from tool names. User can now create elements inside list compartments via the containing node’s palette and the new element is created inside the correct compartment. General View diagram palette has been reorganized. New tool sections have been added to group semantically node tools by creation concept. In the Details view, standard libraries are now displayed in Reference Widget’s model browser dialog. getAllReachable() util service used to retrieve the elements of a given type has been improved to reduce its time execution. FeatureTyping Edge creation tool has been added to set the type of a Usage. Add kind property from RequirementConstraintMembership on Constraint core properties.

By following these instructions, you’ll configure your local environment with all required dependencies, tools, and services, enabling you to develop, test, and troubleshoot the product effectively on your own machine. SysON uses PostgreSQL as its database. For development or local testing, the simplest approach is to initiate a PostgreSQL instance using Docker. docker run -p 5433:5432 --name syson-postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd \\ -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db \\ -d postgres For Windows users, here is the same command on one line: docker run -p 5433:5432 --name syson-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=dbuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dbpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=syson-db -d postgres This may take a while the first time you run this as Docker will first pull the PostgreSQL image. If you don’t have Docker or prefer to use an existing PostgreSQL installation, modify the following command-line parameters and ensure the POSTGRES_USER possesses administrative rights on the database. These rights are necessary for the automatic creation of the database schema. Before you run the application, please ensure you have following the prerequisites and downloaded the JAR (org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar) from the download section. Go to the folder containing the org.eclipse.syson.syson-application-YYYY.M.X.jar and run the command:\" java -jar path\\to\\your\\syson-application-YEAR.MONTH.0.jar \\ --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/syson-db \\ --spring.datasource.username=dbuser \\ --spring.datasource.password=dbpwd Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to experience SysON. To end your local testing session, ensure you stop the running PostgreSQL Docker container using the command docker kill syson-postgres.

It’s possible to turn-off and turn-on the synchronization between the Project Explorer and the current selection in the Project Editor. When synchronization is enabled, if you selects an element inside a representation, the Project Explorer view will ensure that the corresponding semantic element is visible and selected. This can require expanding new tree items which were previously not visible or scrolling the Project Explorer’s view. When moving between elements in a representation, this can quickly result in an Project Explorer view with many tree items expanded, which can be confusing. The Synchronize toggle button in the Project Explorer can be used to disable this synchronization. When synchronization is disabled, tree items that are already expanded in the Project Explorer are still selected, but no new tree items are automatically expanded.

The SysON supports a subset of the SysML v2 textual syntax, which allows you to update several elements simultaneously. This makes it more efficient to edit models. In general, you can edit the label of a shape in a diagram, and the diagram editor tries to interpret your input and update the corresponding element properties. If an element has a complex name such as someElementName[x]:someTypeName:>someElement, when editing, you must retain all the written parts; otherwise, you risk unsetting some values. Here are some shortcuts for efficiently editing SysON models: Typing someName updates the name of the selected element. Typing <someShortName> updates the short name of the selected element. If someShortName is empty (i.e. when typing <>) the short name of the selected element is deleted. Typing :SomeTypeName, sets the type of the selected element to SomeTypeName. If SomeTypeName doesn’t exist, it’s created as an appropriate type element (for example Item Definition, Part Definition, …​) within the same parent container as the selected element. Typing [x] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to x. Typing [1..x] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to 1..x. Typing [x..*] on an element or a relationship sets its cardinality to x..*. Typing someElement:>otherElement on a element sets someElement as a subsetting of the otherElement if both element are of the same type. Otherwise, it creates a specialization relationship between someElement and otherElement. Typing someElement:>>otherElement on an element sets someElement as a redefinition of otherElement. These shortcuts offer a convenient way to update model elements efficiently.","title":"Model management","component":"syson","version":"main","name":"model-management","url":"/syson/main/user-manual/hands-on/how-tos/model-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.
