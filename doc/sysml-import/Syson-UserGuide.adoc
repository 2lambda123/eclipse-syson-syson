== Introduction
This document aims to provide users with an understanding of the sysON file import.

== File import
Before importing a file, you need to make sure that all the dependencies of this file are also imported, and this, recursively. Otherwise some relationship won't be resolved.

For example if you want to import a file that uses third party libraries, you will need to import the third party libraries before the actual file, otherwise you might have unreferenced relations.
