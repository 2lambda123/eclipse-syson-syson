== v2024.3.0

=== Breaking changes

- Refactor Node Descriptions Providers in General View: all Definitions and Usages Node Descriptions Providers (e.g. `PartDefinitionNodeDescriptionProvider` or `ItemUsageNodeDescriptionProvider`) have been replaced by two new Node Descriptions Providers: `DefinitionNodeDescriptionProvider` and `UsageNodeDescriptionProvider`.
- Switch to Sirius Web 2024.3.0: `GeneralViewRegistryConfigurer` has been renamed to `GeneralViewDescriptionProvider` as it now implements `IEditingContextRepresentationDescriptionProvider` instead of `IRepresentationDescriptionRegistryConfigurer`. Same for `InterconnectionViewRegistryConfigurer`.
`SysMLv2ObjectService` has been renamed into `SysMLv2LabelService` as it now implements `ILabelServiceDelegate` instead of `IObjectServiceDelegate`.
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/93[#93] [diagrams] Refactor diagrams code with creation of the diagram-common-view module to gather all cross diagram tools:
  * `DescriptionNameGenerator` is no longer a static class with static methods.
  There should be one name generator per diagram owning the diagram prefix used to prefix all descriptions for this diagram (for instance `GVDescriptionNameGenerator`)

=== Dependency update

- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/71[#71] [releng] Add `commons-io 2.11.0` dependency explicitly in `syson-application-configuration`.

=== Bug fixes
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/118[#118] Subclassification edge has been broken during this release

=== Improvements

- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/75[#75] [services] Improve direct edit.
The direct edit of labels in diagrams now handles partial edition.
The partial edit allows to:
** "newName" -> set a new name to the element
** "newName :" -> set a new name and delete typing
** "newName :>" -> set a new name and delete subsetting/- subclassification
** "newName :>>" -> set a new name and delete redefinition
** "newName =" -> set a new name and delete feature value
** "newName []" -> set a new name and delete the multiplicity range
** ": newType" -> set a new type
** ":> newType" -> set a new subsetting/subclassification
** ":>> newType" -> set a new redefinition
** "= newValue" -> set a new value
** "[newRange]" -> set a new range
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/78[#78] [explorer] Review new objects candidates in Explorer view context menu.
Only provides candidates that will make sense.
Also allow the creation of elements with their containing Membership in one click.
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/80[#80] [diagrams] Add recursive version of the "Add existing elements" tool.
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/86[#86] [general-view] Improves Package headers' width to better handle longer labels and prevents Package children from overlapping the Package body's west border.

- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/88[#88] [diagrams] Improves creation tool names by adding spaces between type words and removing "Usage" from tool names.
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/91[#91] [general-view] Add NodeTools to create compartment elements from the compartment's parent node. For example, it is now possible to create an `AttributeUsage` in the `PartDefinition` palette.
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/93[#93] [diagrams] Reorganize General View diagram palette with several tool sections.
- https://github.com/eclipse-syson/syson/issues/105[#105] [details] In the Details view, display the standard libraries in Reference Widget's model browser dialog.

They will be only accessible through the model browser dialog.
